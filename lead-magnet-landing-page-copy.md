### Product Title
7 AI-Age Affirmations — Free Printable Card Deck

### Short Description (for previews)
Daily affirmations designed for humans navigating a world of AI. Print them. Pin them up. Read them every morning.

### Full Product Description

**Feeling anxious about AI? You're not broken. You're paying attention.**

The headlines are relentless. AI is replacing writers. AI is coming for designers. AI is taking over everything.

And somewhere in the back of your mind, a quiet voice asks: *Where do I fit in all of this?*

This free printable card deck is for that voice.

**Inside you'll get:**

- 7 original affirmations written specifically for the AI age
- Beautiful print-ready cards (cut and pin to your desk, mirror, or laptop)
- A morning practice guide to make affirmations actually stick
- A reflection prompt for each affirmation to deepen the practice

**These aren't generic "I am worthy" affirmations.** They're specific, grounded, and built for the reality you're living in right now:

> *"My intuition is trained on a lifetime of being human. No dataset compares."*

> *"I use AI as a collaborator, not a replacement for my own thinking."*

> *"Technology amplifies my creativity. It does not replace it."*

**Who this is for:**
- Professionals feeling uncertain about AI's impact on their career
- Anyone who uses AI tools daily and wants to maintain their confidence
- People who want affirmations that feel *relevant* to the modern world
- Tech workers, creatives, PMs, marketers, and knowledge workers

**What people are saying:**
*(Update with real testimonials after launch)*

> "Finally — affirmations that don't feel like they were written in 2015."

> "I pinned the 'no dataset compares' card to my monitor. Read it every morning."

**How to use:**
1. Download the PDF
2. Print on cardstock (or regular paper works too)
3. Cut along the lines
4. Pin your favorites where you'll see them daily
5. Read one aloud each morning for 7 days

It takes 30 seconds. And it might change how you walk into your day.

**This is free.** Just enter your email and it's yours.

We'll also send you a short welcome series with more affirmations and the story behind this project. Unsubscribe anytime.
