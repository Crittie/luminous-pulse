### Product Title
The 5-Day Grounding Practice — For When the Future Feels Heavy

### Short Description (for previews)
A free guided practice for anyone carrying the weight of a world that's changing fast. Five days. Five grounding words. Five moments of stillness in the noise.

### Full Product Description

**if the future feels heavier than you can carry, this practice is for you.**

the headlines won't stop. AI is replacing this. automation is reshaping that. the job market is shifting beneath your feet.

and somewhere underneath all of it, a quiet voice asks: *where do I fit in a world that's moving this fast?*

this practice is for that voice.

**what's inside:**

- 5 grounding affirmations — written for this exact moment in history, not generic positivity
- a reflection prompt for each day to help you sit with what's true
- a 2-minute breathwork exercise for when the noise gets loud
- a morning practice guide to make grounding a daily habit

**these aren't "good vibes only" affirmations.** they're specific, grounded, and built for the reality you're living in right now:

> *"There is something in you that change cannot touch. Today, I remember it."*

> *"I am not broken for feeling anxious. I am awake in a world that is changing fast."*

> *"The part of you that loves cannot be automated."*

**who this is for:**
- anyone whose future feels uncertain — because of AI, because of change, because of a world that looks nothing like what you planned
- people who want to feel grounded, not optimized
- anyone who carries a quiet dread about headlines they can't stop reading
- professionals, creatives, and anyone who wants honest hope — not toxic positivity

**how to use:**
1. download the PDF
2. each morning for 5 days, read the grounding affirmation
3. spend 2 minutes with the breathwork exercise
4. journal with the reflection prompt
5. notice how you feel on Day 5

it takes two minutes a morning. it might change how you walk into your day.

**this is free.** just enter your email and it's yours.
