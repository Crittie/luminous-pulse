### Product Title
The 5-Day Grounding Practice — For When the Future Feels Heavy

### Short Description (for previews)
A free guided practice for anyone carrying the weight of a world that's changing fast. Five days. Five grounding words. Five moments of stillness in the noise.

### Full Product Description

**If the future feels heavier than you can carry, this practice is for you.**

The headlines won't stop. AI is replacing this. Automation is disrupting that. The job market is shifting beneath your feet.

And somewhere underneath all of it, a quiet voice asks: *Where do I fit in a world that's moving this fast?*

This practice is for that voice.

**What's inside:**

- 5 grounding affirmations — written for this exact moment in history, not generic positivity
- A reflection prompt for each day to help you sit with what's true
- A 2-minute breathwork exercise for when the noise gets loud
- A morning practice guide to make grounding a daily habit

**These aren't "good vibes only" affirmations.** They're specific, grounded, and built for the reality you're living in right now:

> *"There is something in you that change cannot touch. Today, I remember it."*

> *"I am not broken for feeling anxious. I am awake in a world that is changing fast."*

> *"The part of you that loves cannot be automated."*

**Who this is for:**
- Anyone whose future feels uncertain — because of AI, because of change, because of a world that looks nothing like what you planned
- People who want to feel grounded, not optimized
- Anyone who carries a quiet dread about headlines they can't stop reading
- Professionals, creatives, and anyone who wants honest hope — not toxic positivity

**How to use:**
1. Download the PDF
2. Each morning for 5 days, read the grounding affirmation
3. Spend 2 minutes with the breathwork exercise
4. Journal with the reflection prompt
5. Notice how you feel on Day 5

It takes two minutes a morning. It might change how you walk into your day.

**This is free.** Just enter your email and it's yours.
