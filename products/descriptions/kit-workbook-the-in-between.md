## Full Product Description

**you're in the in-between.**

the space after the ending and before whatever comes next. the place where LinkedIn says "pivot" and your body says "I can't move." where everyone has advice and none of it touches what you're actually feeling.

**this is the workbook for that place.**

not a quick fix. not a 5-step plan. 90 pages of the slow, honest work of sitting with who you are when the title, the routine, and the certainty are gone.

**what's inside — 8 chapters:**

**chapter 1: the freefall**
for the first days. when the ground disappeared and you're still falling. prompts for naming what happened, what it took from you, and what you're feeling right now — not what you're supposed to be feeling.

**chapter 2: the fog**
for when you can't think straight. can't plan. can't even journal. gentle prompts designed for foggy brains. no pressure. no productivity.

**chapter 3: the grief**
for the loss nobody calls a loss. the team. the identity. the morning routine. the belonging. guided grief work with space for every stage.

**chapter 4: the anger**
for the fury that has nowhere to go. the boss, the algorithm, the economy, the system. a section that says: your anger is not a problem. it's information.

**chapter 5: the quiet**
for the stillness that comes after the storm. the emptiness. the "now what?" this chapter teaches you to stay in the quiet instead of rushing to fill it.

**chapter 6: the search**
for when you start looking. not for a job — for yourself. values excavation, identity mapping, "who was I before this?" work.

**chapter 7: the first steps**
for the earliest movements. not a plan. not a goal. just one foot in front of the other. micro-experiments, small commitments, permission to be a beginner.

**chapter 8: the becoming**
for the person you're growing into. a future self letter, a 90-day intention, and printable affirmation cards to carry forward.

**plus 2 grounding interludes:**
- physiological sigh practice (the fastest evidence-based calm-down technique)
- coherent breathing (slow, rhythmic breathing at 5 breaths per minute)
- a mid-journey permission slip

**each chapter includes:**
- a navy section opener with the chapter's core truth
- guided reflection prompts (not generic — specific to displaced worker experiences)
- body check-ins (where are you holding this?)
- generous writing space
- a closing affirmation

**this is the workbook that defines luminous pulse.**

it's the longest. the deepest. the one that asks you to sit with the hardest questions. and it's the one people tell me changed how they see the transition they're in.

designed to be printed and written in by hand. because neuroscience shows that handwriting activates emotional processing centers that typing can't reach. when you're processing identity shifts, your hands need to be part of the conversation.

**$27. 90 pages. for the space between who you were and who you're becoming.**

## Post-Purchase Email

**Subject**: welcome to the in-between.

**Body**:

hey —

"the in-between" is attached. all 90 pages of it.

I know that sounds like a lot. it's not meant to be done in a weekend. this workbook is designed to be your companion for weeks — maybe months. open it when you're ready. close it when you need to. come back when something shifts.

my suggestion: start with Chapter 1. read the opener. do the first prompt. put it down.

if you're past the freefall stage and already in the anger or the quiet, skip ahead. the chapters are designed to stand alone. there's no wrong starting point.

print it if you can. the act of writing by hand changes what this workbook can do for you. a pen and paper activate parts of your brain that a keyboard can't reach.

the grounding practice on page 24 (the physiological sigh) — learn it now. you'll use it throughout the workbook and throughout the transition. two quick inhales through the nose, one long exhale through the mouth. three rounds. that's your anchor.

you are in the in-between. and that's exactly where you're supposed to be.

with you in this,
Christie

P.S. — Chapter 8 includes a letter to your future self. when you get there, write it, seal it, and date it 90 days out. don't peek. trust the process.
