## Full Product Description

**the hardest part wasn't losing the job. it was losing the answer to "what do you do?"**

that question used to be easy. now it's a landmine at every dinner party, every networking event, every family gathering. because somewhere along the way, you became your title. and when the title disappeared, a part of you went with it.

**this workbook is for the part that's still here.**

**what's inside — 8 guided exercises:**

1. **the roles inventory** — mapping every role you play beyond your job title. you are more than you remember.
2. **values archaeology** — digging beneath the career to find the values that were always there. the job was the vehicle, not the destination.
3. **"20 things that make me, me"** — the simplest and hardest exercise. 20 truths about yourself that have nothing to do with work.
4. **the origin story** — tracing the thread from who you were before the career to who you might be after it. your story didn't start at onboarding.
5. **composting the old identity** — a ritual for letting go of the title without pretending it didn't matter. it mattered. and you can still put it down.
6. **seeds of who I'm becoming** — planting the earliest fragments of what comes next. not a plan. not a pivot. just seeds.
7. **the permission slip** — a signed declaration that you are allowed to not know yet.
8. **letter to your future self** — sealed, dated, to be opened in 90 days. the person who writes this letter and the person who opens it will not be the same.

**plus:**
- a grounding interlude with the physiological sigh (the fastest evidence-based technique for calming your nervous system — 2 inhales through the nose, 1 long exhale through the mouth)
- printable affirmation cards for the identity-rebuilding journey

**this is the work nobody tells you to do.**

career coaches tell you to update your resume. LinkedIn tells you to "stay visible." nobody tells you to sit with the identity crisis first. to grieve the person you were. to figure out who you are underneath the title before you rush to find a new one.

**this workbook does that work.**

**$15. 49 pages. designed to be printed and written in by hand.**

**Subject**: the identity work starts here.

**Body**:

hey —

"who am I without the title?" is attached.

my suggestion: start with Exercise 3 — "20 things that make me, me." it sounds simple. it's not. most people get stuck around number 8. that's where the real work begins.

print this out if you can. neuroscience shows that handwriting activates emotional processing centers that typing can't reach. when you're rebuilding identity, your hands need to be part of the conversation.

the letter to your future self (Exercise 8) — write it, seal it, put a date on it 90 days from now. don't peek. the person who opens that letter will be different from the person writing it. that's the whole point.

you are more than the title. this workbook is where you start remembering that.

with you in this,
Christie

P.S. — Exercise 5 (composting the old identity) is the one people tell me changed something. if it resonates, I'd love to hear. just reply.
