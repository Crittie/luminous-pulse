## Full Product Description

**the interview is in 30 minutes. your hands are shaking.**

you've rehearsed your answers. you've practiced your story. but your body didn't get the memo.

your chest is tight. your voice will crack if you try to explain the gap. and somewhere underneath the preparation, there's a version of you whispering: *what if they can tell?*

**this guide was built for that exact moment.**

not the night before. not the morning of. the *30 minutes before*. when your nervous system needs something your resume can't give it.

**what's inside:**

- **a timed 30-minute pre-interview ritual** — minute-by-minute grounding from T-30 to T-5, so you walk in steady instead of spiraling
- **gap story reframes** — templates for talking about your career gap without apologizing for it, plus drafting space to write your version
- **3 evidence-based nervous system techniques:**
  - the physiological sigh (2 inhales + 1 long exhale — the fastest way to calm your nervous system, backed by Stanford research)
  - the butterfly hug (bilateral stimulation used in EMDR therapy — cross your arms, tap alternating shoulders)
  - the cold reset (TIPP technique from DBT — cold water on your face to activate the dive reflex and slow your heart rate)
- **a post-interview decompression sequence** — shake-it-off → long exhales → cold water → name it. because what happens after matters too.
- **identity affirmations** — for remembering who you are regardless of what happens in that room
- **a tear-out quick reference card** — all techniques on one page, designed to fold into your pocket or bag

**this is not interview prep. this is nervous system prep.**

the person who walks into that room calm, grounded, and breathing? that's you. not because you're performing confidence — because you've given your body what it actually needs.

**$9. yours instantly. fits in your pocket.**

## Post-Purchase Email

**Subject**: your grounding guide is here. breathe first.

**Body**:

hey —

your copy of "before the room" is attached.

here's what I want you to do before you need it: go to Part 3 — the nervous system toolkit. try the physiological sigh right now. two quick inhales through the nose, one long exhale through the mouth. do it three times.

that's your anchor. the one you'll use when your hands start shaking before the interview.

the tear-out card on the last page? print it. fold it. put it in the bag you carry to interviews. when the moment comes, you'll have something to hold onto.

you don't need to be fearless. you just need to be grounded.

with you in this,
Christie

P.S. — this is one piece of a larger collection. if you want to go deeper into the identity work underneath the anxiety, check out "who am I without the title?" — it's the workbook I wish I'd had.
