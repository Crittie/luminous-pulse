## Page 2: How to Use This Practice

**your morning practice (2 minutes)**

1. Each morning, read the day's grounding word.
2. Say it aloud, three times, slowly.
3. Take 2 minutes with the breathwork exercise.
4. Sit with the reflection prompt.
5. Notice how you feel by Day 5.

The feeling follows the words. Not the other way around.

*Pin your favorite to your desk, mirror, or laptop lid. Let it find you throughout the day.*

**Who this is for:**

Anyone carrying the weight of a world that's changing fast. If you've been laid off, fear you're next, or just feel the ground shifting beneath you — this is your practice.

## Page 3: Day 1 — Come Home

**"I am whole before I open my laptop."**

breathe: Place both feet flat on the floor. Inhale through your nose for 4 counts. Hold for 4 counts. Exhale through your mouth for 6 counts. Repeat 3 times.

reflect: When was the last time you felt like yourself — not your job title, not your output, just you? What were you doing? That person is still here.

---

## Page 4: Day 2 — Remember

**"My intuition was trained by a lifetime of being alive. Nothing compares."**

breathe: Close your eyes. Inhale and silently say "I am." Exhale and silently say "here." Repeat for 2 minutes.

reflect: Think of a time your gut feeling was right — when the data said one thing but you knew better. That instinct didn't get laid off. It's still running.

---

## Page 5: Day 3 — Name the Feeling

**"I am not broken for feeling anxious. I am awake in a world that is changing fast."**

breathe: The 4-7-8 breath. Inhale through your nose for 4 counts. Hold for 7 counts. Exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 counts. Repeat 4 times.

reflect: Name three feelings you're carrying right now. Don't judge them. Don't fix them. Just name them. (Example: fear, anger, relief.) Naming them takes their power.

## Page 6: Day 4 — Permission

**"I give myself permission to navigate this moment with curiosity, not panic."**

breathe: Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. Breathe so that only the belly hand moves. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system — the part that says "you are safe." 10 breaths.

reflect: What would change if you replaced "I should know what's next" with "I'm allowed to not know yet"? Write down what you'd stop doing. Write down what you'd start.

---

## Page 7: Day 5 — What Cannot Be Touched

**"There is something in me that change cannot touch. Today, I remember it."**

breathe: Stand up. Feet on the floor. Shoulders down. Three deep breaths — in through the nose, out through the mouth. On the last exhale, let go of everything you're carrying that isn't yours.

reflect: Underneath the job title, the industry shift, the anxiety — what is the truest thing about you? The thing that existed before all of this and will exist after? Write it down. Keep it close.

## Page 8: Your Permission Slip

**You are allowed to:**

- Feel the full weight of what's happening without rushing to "move on"
- Not have a plan yet
- Say "I don't know" when people ask what's next
- Step away from the noise without calling it "falling behind"
- Grieve a job, even if you weren't happy there
- Take longer than you thought you would
- Ask for help
- Rest

**This permission does not expire.**

## Page 9: The Morning Practice (Keep This)

**Make grounding a daily habit:**

1. Pick one grounding word each morning (start with your favorite from this practice)
2. Say it aloud three times before you open your phone
3. Take 5 breaths with your feet on the floor
4. Set the grounding word as your phone wallpaper for the day
5. When the anxiety comes — and it will — return to the word

The practice is not about feeling better. It's about feeling grounded. The difference matters.
