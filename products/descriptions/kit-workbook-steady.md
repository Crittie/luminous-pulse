## Full Product Description

**the crisis passes. what's left is the quiet.**

the initial shock fades. the grief softens. the anger finds somewhere to live. and then you're just... here. in the after. wondering how to build something steady out of all this uncertainty.

**this workbook is for the after.**

not the emergency. not the crisis. the slow, patient work of checking in with yourself week after week. building a rhythm that belongs to you — not to a company, not to a title, not to someone else's timeline.

**what's inside:**

**12 weekly spreads, each with 4 pages:**
- **Monday intention** — one question to set the tone for your week
- **mid-week check-in** — a body scan + honest reflection on where you actually are (not where you think you should be)
- **Friday reflection** — looking back at the week with a one-word summary and writing space
- **weekend analog activity** — one offline thing to do with your hands, your feet, or your senses. because healing doesn't happen on a screen.

**3 monthly themes:**
- **month 1: grounding** (weeks 1-4) — finding your feet. what's still true. what you can count on.
- **month 2: reconnecting** (weeks 5-8) — reaching toward the people, places, and parts of yourself you've been avoiding.
- **month 3: building** (weeks 9-12) — planting something. not a plan. just a practice.

**3 monthly reviews** (2 pages each):
- what shifted this month?
- what do you want to carry forward?
- what are you ready to release?

**this workbook is not about productivity.**

there is no goal-setting section. no weekly KPIs. no "by week 12 you will have..." promises. this is about showing up for yourself on Monday, checking in on Wednesday, reflecting on Friday, and resting on the weekend.

that's it. that's the whole practice.

**$15. 63 pages. 12 weeks of steady ground.**

**Subject**: 12 weeks of steady starts now.

**Body**:

hey —

"steady" is attached.

here's how to use it: start on a Monday. any Monday. read the intention prompt, write whatever comes, and put it down. that's it for day one.

on Wednesday, do the mid-week check-in. on Friday, the reflection. on the weekend, try the analog activity — even if it feels strange. especially if it feels strange.

this workbook works best printed. the act of handwriting slows your brain down in a way that typing can't. and the whole point of this practice is slowing down.

one week at a time. one page at a time. no rushing.

you've been through the hard part. this is the steady part.

with you in this,
Christie

P.S. — the analog activities are my favorite part. if you try one and it surprises you, tell me about it. just reply.
