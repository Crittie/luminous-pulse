## Full Product Description

**you don't need a big workbook right now. you need one page.**

one prompt. one breath. one thing to do with your hands. one sentence that reminds you who you are.

that's what this practice gives you. every day. for 30 days.

**what's inside:**

**30 daily pages, each with:**
- **a grounding prompt** — not generic journaling ("how do you feel today?"). specific, named, honest. ("what's the thing you're most afraid to say out loud about where you are right now?")
- **a body practice** — guided breathwork or somatic exercises, 5 minutes max. box breathing, 4-7-8 technique, progressive relaxation, body scans. each one explained step by step.
- **one offline thing** — a suggestion to do something with your senses: walk barefoot, hold a warm cup, rearrange one shelf, write a word on paper and fold it up. small acts of presence.
- **writing space** — generous ruled lines for wherever the prompt takes you
- **a closing micro-affirmation** — one sentence to carry with you into the rest of the day

**4 weekly themes:**
- **week 1: arriving** (days 1-7) — landing in the present. acknowledging where you actually are.
- **week 2: feeling** (days 8-14) — making room for what you've been avoiding.
- **week 3: remembering** (days 15-21) — reconnecting with the parts of yourself that existed before the title.
- **week 4: planting** (days 22-28) — putting something small into the ground. not a plan. a seed.
- **days 29-30: emerging** — looking back at where you started, and forward at what's growing.

**4 weekly pauses** — end-of-week check-ins with body scans and space to notice what shifted.

**11 "deep days"** — key days get an extra writing page for when the prompt opens something bigger.

**30 printable affirmation cards** — dashed-border cards in the appendix, 9 per page. cut them out. put them in your pocket. tape one to your mirror. carry today's affirmation with you.

**this is not a journal. this is a daily practice.**

the difference: a journal asks you to generate. a practice gives you structure. when your brain is foggy and your motivation is gone, you don't need a blank page — you need one clear prompt, one guided breath, and one thing to do. this gives you that. every day.

**$17. 66 pages. 30 days of ground.**

## Post-Purchase Email

**Subject**: day 1 starts when you're ready.

**Body**:

hey —

"30 days of ground" is attached.

here's my ask: don't read ahead. open to Day 1 and just do that one page. the prompt, the breathwork, the offline thing. that's it.

if you miss a day, skip it. this is not a streak app. the practice is still here when you come back.

the affirmation cards in the appendix? print them. cut along the dashed lines. put Day 1's card somewhere you'll see it. swap it out each day or keep the ones that stick.

one day at a time. that's the whole philosophy.

you've got this. one page at a time.

with you in this,
Christie

P.S. — Day 7 and Day 14 tend to be the ones that crack something open. if that happens, just keep writing. that's what the extra pages are for.
