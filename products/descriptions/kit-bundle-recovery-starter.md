## Full Product Description

**you're in the early days. you need more than one thing.**

the crisis kit for the panic. the grief journal for the sadness. the identity workbook for the "who am I now?" that comes at 3am.

**this bundle puts all three in your hands at once.**

**what's inside:**

**1. the emergency grounding kit** (15 pages · $9 value)
10 emergency grounding cards, the 4-7-8 breathwork script, and a printable permission slip. for the moments that won't wait.

**2. tender landings** (44 pages · $12 value)
a grief journal for career loss. 6 sections: naming the loss, the non-linear grief cycle, anger is welcome here, the body keeps the score, letters you'll never send, what remains. plus a 5-4-3-2-1 grounding practice and a grief-specific permission slip.

**3. who am I without the title?** (49 pages · $15 value)
8 guided exercises for identity reclamation: roles inventory, values archaeology, "20 things that make me, me," composting the old identity, seeds of who I'm becoming, and a letter to your future self. plus the physiological sigh practice and printable affirmation cards.

**why these three together:**

they map to the three things happening simultaneously in the early days:
- **panic** → the emergency kit catches you
- **grief** → tender landings holds the loss
- **identity crisis** → the identity workbook starts the rebuilding

you don't have to use them in order. open whichever one matches where you are right now. the emergency kit when you're spiraling. the grief journal when you're sad. the identity workbook when you're lost.

**$36 value. yours for $27. all in one PDF with branded section dividers between each workbook.**

**Body**:

hey —

"the recovery starter" is attached — all 3 workbooks in one file.

here's how to use it: don't start at the beginning. flip through the table of contents on page 2 and find the workbook that matches where you are *right now*.

- spiraling? start with the **emergency grounding kit** (page 4)
- grieving? start with **tender landings** (page 20)
- lost? start with **who am I without the title?** (page 65)

print whichever section you need first. you don't have to print all 113 pages at once. just the section that's calling to you today.

these three workbooks were designed to work together but stand alone. there's no wrong starting point and no wrong order.

you've got all three tools now. use them whenever you need them.

with you in this,
Christie

P.S. — the unsent letters in "tender landings" and the "20 things that make me, me" exercise in the identity workbook? those are the two things people tell me changed something. start there if you want to go straight to the deep work.
