## Full Product Description

**nobody calls it grief when it's a job.**

but that's what it is. the loss of routine, identity, belonging, purpose. the empty calendar. the silence where Slack notifications used to be. the way you still reach for your laptop at 8am even though there's nowhere to log in.

**this journal was written for that grief.**

not the inspirational kind. not the "everything happens for a reason" kind. the real kind — the kind that lives in your chest and doesn't have a name yet.

**what's inside:**

- **naming the loss** — prompts for identifying what you actually lost (hint: it wasn't just the paycheck)
- **the non-linear grief cycle** — a check-in for all 5 stages, because grief doesn't move in a straight line. you might be angry and bargaining and accepting all in the same afternoon.
- **anger is welcome here** — dedicated space for the fury that has nowhere to go. because "stay positive" is not a grief strategy.
- **the body keeps the score** — somatic awareness exercises for noticing where your body is holding the loss. your shoulders already know.
- **letters you'll never send** — 3 unsent letters: to the person who delivered the news, to the company or industry, and to yourself. the most cathartic section in this entire journal.
- **what remains** — for finding what's still true about you after the title is gone

**plus 2 interludes:**
- a 5-4-3-2-1 grounding practice (name 5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you touch, 2 you smell, 1 you taste — a CBT technique for when the grief gets loud)
- a grief-specific permission slip

**this is not a career workbook. this is a grief journal that happens to be about work.**

the price is low on purpose. I know what it feels like to be financially stressed and emotionally wrecked at the same time. $12 shouldn't be the barrier between you and a place to put all of this.

**$12. 44 pages. yours to write in, cry on, and come back to.**

## Post-Purchase Email

**Subject**: your grief journal is here. take your time.

**Body**:

hey —

"tender landings" is attached.

I'm not going to tell you to start at the beginning. open it wherever feels right. if you're angry, go to Section 3. if you need to cry, go to Section 5 — the unsent letters. if you don't know what you're feeling yet, start with Section 1 and just name what's there.

the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding practice on page 18 is there for when it gets too heavy. use it as many times as you need.

there is no timeline for this. there is no right way to grieve a career. there is just you, and this page, and whatever truth you're ready to put down.

I see you in this.

with care,
Christie

P.S. — if the unsent letters section hits different, I'd love to hear about it. just reply to this email. you don't have to share what you wrote — just that it mattered.
