## Post-Purchase Email

**Subject**: 404 pages of sanctuary. here's where to start.

**Body**:

hey —

"the complete grounding collection" is attached — all 8 workbooks, 404 pages.

I know. that's a lot. so here's your map:

**if you're in crisis right now:** start with the Emergency Grounding Kit (page 4). it's 15 pages designed for this exact moment.

**if you have an interview coming up:** jump to "before the room" (page 20). the 30-minute ritual starts on page 22.

**if you're grieving:** "tender landings" starts on page 49. the unsent letters section is on page 75.

**if you're lost:** "who am I without the title?" starts on page 94. Exercise 3 — "20 things that make me, me" — is where most people begin.

**if you want a daily practice:** "30 days of ground" starts on page 196. one page per day, starting whenever you're ready.

**if you want the deep work:** "the in-between" starts on page 263. 90 pages from freefall to first steps.

you don't have to use all of it. you don't have to use it in order. just open to wherever you need today.

print sections as you go — you don't need to print 400 pages at once. start with whatever's calling to you.

this collection is yours forever. it'll be here tomorrow, next week, and six months from now when something shifts and you need a different section.

you are held.

with you in this,
Christie

P.S. — the affirmation cards in the "30 days of ground" section (page 253) and the future self letter in "the in-between" (page 349) are the two things I'd print first. one for your pocket. one for your future.
