# reel animation guide — luminous pulse
## how to bring these slides to life in canva video

---

### setup

1. open canva → create new design → **video** → set to **1080 × 1920px** (instagram reel)
2. import your slides: upload → select all PNGs for the reel → drag into timeline in order
3. each PNG becomes one scene. all slides are pre-sized correctly — no resizing needed.

### animation per slide

**entry animation:** `fade` or `rise` (gentle)
- go to `animate` → `page animations` → select **fade** (0.6–0.8 sec duration)
- or use **rise** for slightly more movement — still slow and intentional
- **avoid:** pop, bounce, tumble, spin, slide fast. nothing reactive or hype.

**the amber dash breath beat:**
the amber dash appears on every slide as a static element. to animate it as a "breath" before the text:
- duplicate the slide → on the first copy, select and delete the text, keep only the background + dash
- set that copy to **0.4–0.6 seconds** duration
- on the second copy (full slide with text), use **fade** entry
- this gives the effect of: dash appears → pause → text fades in

### timing per slide (recommended)

| slide type | duration |
|-----------|---------|
| very short line (1–4 words) | 1.5–2.0 sec |
| medium line (5–8 words) | 2.5–3.0 sec |
| longer line (9+ words) | 3.5–4.0 sec |
| end card | 3.0–4.0 sec |

**reel 1 — "you're awake" (target: 15 sec)**
slides 1-3 ("you're awake / I know / here's one thing"): 1.5 sec each
slides 4-7 (breathwork instructions): 1.5 sec each
slide 8 ("you don't have to solve anything"): 3.0 sec
end card: 2.5 sec

**reel 2 — "the honest timeline" (target: 25 sec)**
slides 1-5 (week 1 through week 16): 2.5 sec each
slides 6-7 ("nobody talks about / we talk about"): 3.0 sec each
end card: 3.0 sec

**reel 3 — "what they say vs what you need" (target: 25 sec)**
"they say" slides: 2.0 sec (they recede — they're dim)
"you need" slides: 3.0 sec (they land — they're full brightness)
end card: 3.0 sec

**reel 4 — "the real stages" (target: 20 sec)**
slide 1 ("the real stages"): 2.0 sec
slides 2-6 (stages 1-5): 2.0 sec each
slide 7 ("nobody talks about stage 5"): 3.5 sec
end card: 2.5 sec

**reel 5 — "the 5-4-3-2-1 reset" (target: 20 sec)**
slide 1 ("when the spiral starts"): 2.0 sec
slides 2-6 (5 through 1): 1.5 sec each
slide 7 ("you're back in the room"): 2.5 sec
slide 8 ("this is yours"): 2.5 sec
end card: 3.0 sec

**reel 6 — "still here" (target: 20 sec)**
slide 1 ("things that are true"): 2.5 sec
slides 2-5 (the truths): 2.5 sec each
slide 6 ("damn it — you are still here"): 4.0 sec
end card: 3.0 sec

### background pulse (optional)

the circular rings in the background are static in the PNGs. if you want them to breathe:
- in canva video, apply a very slow **zoom** to the background layer (1.0 → 1.03 scale over the full reel duration)
- this is the ceiling of motion for this brand. subtle. not a zoom. a breath.
- do not add any glow, color shift, or particle effects.

---

### audio

**recommended canva audio:**
- search "ambient" or "lo-fi" in canva's audio library
- look for tracks with: no drops, no builds, no beat switching
- target: soft piano, sparse ambient, minimal percussion
- volume: keep low (40–60%) — the words are the audio. music is the room.

**tracks that work:**
- "soft morning" or "quiet study" type labels
- anything under 80 BPM
- avoid anything labeled "motivational," "uplifting," "inspiring" — too energetic for this brand

---

### export settings

- **format:** MP4
- **quality:** 1080p
- **no watermark** (canva pro) or remove before downloading

### posting

- add captions in instagram's reel editor (not burned into the video)
- copy caption text from `scroll-stopping-copy.md` — each reel has a companion caption
- add audio in instagram's editor if not added in canva
- save all source PNGs — you'll reuse this system for month 2+ content
