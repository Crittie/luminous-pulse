A dried flower and a small amber candle at the edge of frame. The workbooks are cream-colored with navy accents. Clean, warm, inviting. The mood is 'start here — we've arranged the first steps for you.' Overhead editorial photography, warm natural light, minimalist styling. No text overlay.

The composition communicates abundance and intention — a complete library of healing tools. Warm amber light, editorial lifestyle photography, shallow depth of field. No text overlay.
