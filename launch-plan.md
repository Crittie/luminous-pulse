# Launch Plan: AI-Optimism Affirmation Brand

## Context

You want to launch an AI-optimism affirmation brand from scratch following the Compass report blueprint. This is a brand new venture (separate from PM prompts), with Instagram as the primary platform. You have 20+ hours/week, under $50/month budget, strong video/content creation skills, and OpenClaw already set up for marketing automation. No brand elements exist yet.

The plan maps every task to one of three owners:
- **You** - tasks requiring your creative eye, voice, and decisions
- **OpenClaw** - automated/recurring marketing tasks
- **Claude Code** - copywriting, research, asset generation, and planning support
