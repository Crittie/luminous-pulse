# Launch Plan: Luminous Pulse — Grounding for Displaced Tech Workers

## Context

Luminous Pulse is a sanctuary brand for tech professionals navigating layoffs, role elimination, and career disruption. Instagram is the primary platform. Budget is under $50/month. Strong video/content creation skills. Claude Code handles copywriting, research, asset generation, and planning support.

**Target audience**: Displaced tech workers — PMs, engineers, designers, marketers (25-45) who've been laid off, fear they're next, or are watching their industry reshape itself.

**Brand positioning**: Where displaced humans come to rest. Not "just upskill" advice. Not doom. Honest hope and grounding for the identity crisis underneath the career crisis.

**Products**:
- Free: "The 5-Day Grounding Practice" (PDF, email capture via Kit form)
- Paid: "The Luminous Pulse Practice: 30 Days of Grounding" ($37 on Kit Commerce, $47 regular)

The plan maps every task to one of two owners:
- **You** — tasks requiring your creative eye, voice, decisions, and platform actions
- **Claude Code** — copywriting, research, asset generation, and planning support
