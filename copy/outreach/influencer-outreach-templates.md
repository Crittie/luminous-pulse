## DM Template 1: Vulnerability Story Creator

> **Use when**: They've shared their own layoff/career crisis story.
> **Tone**: Peer-to-peer, not brand-to-influencer.

Hi [name],

Your post about [specific detail — e.g., "the moment you realized your badge didn't work anymore"] hit me hard. I had a nearly identical experience — sitting in a meeting where someone casually said "we'll just have AI do that part" about the work I was most proud of.

That moment led me to start Luminous Pulse — grounding practices specifically for displaced tech workers. Not career advice. Not "just upskill." The emotional support nobody's offering.

I'd love to send you our free 5-Day Grounding Practice — no strings, genuinely think you'd connect with it. And if it resonates, maybe we could do a joint Instagram Live on navigating the identity crisis underneath the career crisis?

Either way — thank you for being honest about this. It matters more than you know.

## DM Template 2: Career Coach / Transition Expert

> **Use when**: They help people navigate career transitions.
> **Tone**: Professional, collaborative, value-forward.

---

Hi [name],

I've been following your work on [specific topic — e.g., "helping PMs pivot into new roles"] and really appreciate how you [specific thing — e.g., "acknowledge the emotional side, not just the tactical"].

I built Luminous Pulse to address something I wasn't seeing anyone else tackle — the identity crisis underneath the career crisis for displaced tech workers. 430,000+ people displaced since 2024, and almost everyone's telling them to upskill. Nobody's asking how they're actually doing.

I think our audiences overlap perfectly. Would you be open to a content swap or joint Live? I could share grounding practices for your audience, and you could share career transition wisdom for mine.

Happy to send you our free toolkit first so you can see if it aligns.

## DM Template 3: Mental Health / Therapist Creator

> **Use when**: They create educational mental health content.
> **Tone**: Respectful of their expertise, humble, clear about what you offer.

---

Hi [name],

Your content on [specific topic — e.g., "naming emotions before trying to fix them"] really resonates with the community I'm building. You put language to something I've been trying to articulate.

I created Luminous Pulse — grounding practices for tech workers navigating layoffs and career disruption. We focus on the emotional processing that has to come before the career strategy: breathwork, affirmations, naming the feeling, nervous system regulation.

I'd love your honest take on our free 5-Day Grounding Practice. If it aligns with your approach, I think a collaboration could genuinely serve both our audiences — your expertise in mental health + our specificity for displaced tech workers.

No pressure at all. Would you be open to me sending it?

## DM Template 4: Breathwork / Mindfulness Practitioner

> **Use when**: They teach breathwork, meditation, or somatic practices.
> **Tone**: Practitioner-to-practitioner, grounded, specific.

---

Hi [name],

I just tried the [specific technique — e.g., "4-7-8 breathwork sequence you shared on Tuesday"] and it genuinely helped me through a rough morning. Thank you for making these practices so accessible.

I'm Christie — I run Luminous Pulse, where I pair grounding practices like breathwork and somatic techniques with affirmations specifically written for displaced tech workers. We share a belief that the body has to settle before the mind can strategize.

I'd love to explore a collaboration — maybe a joint Instagram Live where you lead a grounding sequence and I share the context of why tech workers specifically need it right now (430,000+ displaced since 2024).

Would you be open to chatting about it?

## DM Template 5: Burnout / Wellness Creator (Zero Budget Collab)

> **Use when**: They talk about burnout, rest, recovery.
> **Tone**: Warm, relatable, collaborative.

---

Hi [name],

Your post about [specific — e.g., "permission to not have a plan yet"] is something I wish I'd seen when I was in the thick of my own career crisis. That message matters.

I created Luminous Pulse — a grounding practice brand for displaced tech workers. Not hustle. Not toxic positivity. Honest hope for the identity crisis underneath the career crisis.

I think our communities would really benefit from each other. A few ideas:

- Story takeover swap (your audience meets my content, mine meets yours)
- Joint grounding challenge (5 days, daily prompt, both of us promote)
- Content swap (I create a carousel for you, you create one for me)

Would any of those interest you? Happy to start with whatever feels easiest.

## Follow-Up Templates

### Follow-Up 1 (Send 5 days after initial DM, if no response)

Hi [name] — just floating this back up in case it got buried. Totally understand if the timing isn't right.

If you're curious, here's the free practice I mentioned: [Kit form link]

Either way, keep doing what you're doing. Your content matters.

Christie

### Follow-Up 2 (Send 5 days after Follow-Up 1, via comment on their post)

Don't DM again. Instead, leave a genuine, thoughtful comment on their most recent post. Be helpful, not promotional. Let the relationship build naturally.

Example comments:
- "This is exactly what I needed to hear today. The part about [specific detail] really landed."
- "I've been sharing this with my community — it's so relevant for tech workers navigating layoffs right now."
- "The way you frame [concept] is so clear. I always learn something from your posts."

### Follow-Up 3 (2 weeks later, only if they engaged with your comment)

---

Hi [name] — I noticed you liked my comment on your [post topic]. Wanted to circle back on the collaboration idea I mentioned a couple weeks ago.

No worries if the timing isn't right — I'm here whenever it makes sense.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Don't** use the same template for everyone — personalize the first line every time
- **Don't** DM on weekends or Mondays (lowest response rates)
- **Don't** follow up more than 3 times — respect their silence
- **Don't** lead with "I love your content!" without specifics
- **Don't** ask for paid promotion when you're offering product-only
- **Don't** send paragraphs — keep DMs under 100 words when possible
- **Don't** forget to engage with their content first (comment for 1-2 weeks before DMing)
- **Do** research them for 3-5 minutes before writing
- **Do** reference a specific post from the last 2 weeks
- **Do** make the value exchange clear
- **Do** give them an easy way to say yes
