## Bio (Short — 50 words)

Christie Parrow is the founder of Luminous Pulse, a grounding practice brand for displaced tech workers. A PMP-certified project manager with 7+ years in tech, she experienced the identity crisis of career displacement firsthand and started writing grounding words for the people carrying that weight in silence.

## Bio (Long — 120 words)

Christie Parrow is the founder of Luminous Pulse, where she creates grounding practices specifically for tech professionals navigating layoffs, role elimination, and the identity crisis underneath the career crisis.

With 7+ years as a PMP-certified project manager in the tech industry, Christie knows what it feels like to have someone in a meeting casually say "We'll just have AI do that part" — and realize they're talking about the work you're most proud of.

That experience led her to start writing grounding words — not generic affirmations, but specific, tender, grounded reminders for people carrying the weight of a world that's changing faster than anyone can process. Luminous Pulse now serves a growing community through Instagram, email, and digital products.

## Episode Topic Pitches

### Topic 1: "The Identity Gap Nobody's Talking About"

**Angle**: Everyone's focused on the skills gap — upskill, reskill, pivot into AI. But the real crisis for displaced tech workers isn't skills. It's identity. When a tool can do what you spent a decade mastering, the question isn't "What should I learn?" — it's "Who am I without my output?"

**Talking points**:
- 430,000+ tech workers displaced since 2024. 28.5% of 2025 layoffs tied to AI adoption.
- The post-layoff emotional journey: shock → anger → bargaining → identity crisis → reconstruction
- Why "just upskill" is the new "just relax" — dismissive, insufficient, and misses the point
- What grounding practices offer that career coaching doesn't: nervous system regulation, identity anchoring
- The unnamed heaviness: how to name the feeling before you try to fix the career

**Your audience will learn**: Why the emotional processing has to come before the career strategy — and what that actually looks like in practice.

---

### Topic 2: "Why Your Humanity Is Your Actual Competitive Advantage"

**Angle**: In a world obsessed with what AI can do, nobody's mapping what humans uniquely bring. Christie's framework identifies the irreplaceable human capacities — presence, ethical judgment, creative intuition, emotional steadiness — and shows how these become more valuable as automation increases, not less.

**Talking points**:
- The things that cannot be downloaded: empathy, judgment, presence, the courage to start over
- How the "original intelligence" framing helps people reclaim their sense of worth
- Practical: how a 2-minute morning grounding practice changes how you show up at work
- The difference between toxic positivity ("You'll be fine!") and honest hope ("This is hard. And you have a track record.")
- Why the wellness industry isn't serving displaced workers — it's too generic, too woo, or too expensive

**Your audience will learn**: A concrete framework for identifying and articulating their irreplaceable human value — useful for job interviews, leadership, and daily resilience.

### Topic 3: "Building a Brand in the White Space Nobody Saw"

**Angle**: There are 430,000+ displaced tech workers and zero brands specifically serving their emotional/spiritual wellness needs. Christie shares how she identified this white space, built a content-first brand on Instagram with zero budget, and created a product ladder from free → $9 → $37 using only Kit and Canva.

**Talking points**:
- How to find a niche by listening to the pain nobody's addressing (Reddit, Blind, LinkedIn comments)
- Building a $0/month tech stack that actually works: Kit + Metricool + ManyChat + Beacons
- Content strategy: why "Name the Feeling" content outperforms aspirational content in uncertain times
- The tripwire model: how a $9 product between free and paid increases conversion 3-5x
- Why vulnerability content on LinkedIn is the most powerful distribution channel for this niche
- Honest numbers: what realistic growth looks like for a solo creator in months 1-3

**Your audience will learn**: A practical, low-budget playbook for building a niche content brand — applicable beyond wellness.

Hi [Host name],

I just listened to your episode on [specific episode] — [specific thing that resonated].

I'm wondering if you'd be open to a conversation about something I don't hear anyone talking about: the identity crisis underneath the tech layoff crisis.

430,000+ tech workers have been displaced since 2024, and everyone's telling them to "just upskill." But the real thing keeping people up at night isn't skills — it's the question "Who am I without my job title?"

I built Luminous Pulse to address that gap — grounding practices specifically for displaced tech workers. I'd love to share the story and the framework with your audience.

Happy to send a one-sheet with topic ideas if you're interested.
