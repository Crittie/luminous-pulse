### Category A: Adapted from Instagram Reels (5 scripts)

*Adapted from IG reels 3, 4, 9, 10, 11 — permission and grounding reels. Hooks sharpened for TikTok pace.*

---

#### TikTok A-1: "you don't need to solve your life tonight" (from IG Reel 9)
**Duration**: 20 sec
**Format**: text on screen, dark room aesthetic, calm ambient audio
**Hook (first 1.5 sec)**: "it's 2am and you're still awake."

**[text on screen, fast first 3 lines, then slow]**

it's 2am and you're still awake.

here.

put your hand on your chest.

breathe in for 4. hold for 4. out for 6.

you don't need to solve anything tonight.

**[end card]**: follow @luminouspulse.co

**Caption template**: see section 6, template 1

---

#### TikTok A-2: "permission to not know" (from IG Reel 3)
**Duration**: 30 sec
**Format**: talking head OR voiceover + calm footage. slow, intentional.
**Hook (first 1.5 sec)**: "nobody gave you permission, so I will."

**[speaking to camera or voiceover]**

nobody gave you permission, so I will.

if you've been carrying the weight of not knowing what comes next — you're not failing. you're being honest.

here's your grounding word for today:

"I give myself permission to not know everything and still be enough."

one more time.

"I give myself permission to not know everything... and still be enough."

carry that.

#### TikTok A-3: "why I started this" (from IG Reel 4)
**Duration**: 45 sec
**Format**: talking head, natural light, personal
**Hook (first 1.5 sec)**: "someone casually said 'we'll just have AI do that part.' they were talking about my work."

**[speaking to camera]**

someone casually said "we'll just have AI do that part." they were talking about the part of the project I was most proud of.

nobody looked at me. but I felt it.

and that night I realized — the spiral wasn't about the tool. it was about identity.

I had tied my worth to my output. and when a machine matched my output, I didn't know who I was without it.

that's the real thing nobody's talking about. it's not a skills gap. it's an identity gap.

so I started writing grounding words. not to fix it. to name it.

if you've felt that unnamed heaviness — you're not alone.

#### TikTok A-4: "the 5-4-3-2-1" (from IG Reel 10)
**Duration**: 20 sec
**Format**: text on screen, fast-paced first 2 sec then slow
**Hook (first 1.5 sec)**: "when the spiral starts at 2am, do this."

**[text on screen]**

when the spiral starts at 2am, do this.

5 things you can see.
4 you can touch.
3 you can hear.
2 you can smell.
1 you can taste.

you're back in the room.

this is yours. use it whenever.

**[end card]**: save this. you'll need it.

---

#### TikTok A-5: "this isn't vibes, it's biology" (from IG Reel 11)
**Duration**: 15 sec
**Format**: text on screen, fast cut, minimal
**Hook (first 1.5 sec)**: "journaling isn't self-help. it's neuroscience."

**[text on screen, fast]**

journaling isn't self-help. it's neuroscience.

handwriting activates emotional processing centers that typing can't reach.

structured reflection reduces cortisol by 25%.

naming emotions reduces amygdala activation by up to 50%.

this isn't vibes. it's biology.

### Category B: Stat-Response Videos (5 scripts)

*Format: show a cold stat, then name the feeling underneath. inspired by Kalshi-style viral unemployment posts.*

---

#### TikTok B-1: "1 in 4"
**Duration**: 25 sec
**Format**: text on screen. stat in bold/large, then slow feeling text.
**Hook (first 1.5 sec)**: **"1 in 4 unemployed Americans have been looking for 6+ months."** (large text, hold 2 sec)
**Audio**: quiet piano or ambient

**[text on screen]**

1 in 4 unemployed Americans have been looking for 6+ months.

but nobody talks about what month 6 actually feels like.

it feels like logging into LinkedIn and forgetting what you'd even search for.

it feels like saying "I'm exploring my options" when you mean "I don't know who I am anymore."

it feels like grief that nobody acknowledges because it's "just a job."

it's not just a job. and you know that.

**[end card]**: follow for words that name it.

---

#### TikTok B-2: "40% of college graduates"
**Duration**: 25 sec
**Format**: text on screen, stat bold, then emotional specificity
**Hook (first 1.5 sec)**: **"40% of college graduates work jobs that don't require a college degree."** (large text)
**Audio**: soft ambient

**[text on screen]**

40% of college graduates work jobs that don't require a college degree.

the stat is cold. the feeling isn't.

the feeling is sitting in your car after a shift wondering what happened to the plan.

the feeling is your parents asking how the career is going and you don't correct them.

the feeling is not broken. it's displaced. and nobody gave it a name.

until now.

**[end card]**: @luminouspulse.co — grounding for the unnamed thing.

---

#### TikTok B-3: "the average job search is 5 months"
**Duration**: 25 sec
**Format**: text on screen
**Hook (first 1.5 sec)**: **"the average job search in 2026 is 5 months."** (large text)
**Audio**: quiet, slow beat

**[text on screen]**

the average job search in 2026 is 5 months.

here's what they don't put in the stat:

month 1: you're hopeful. you update the resume. you tell people it's exciting.

month 3: you stop telling people.

month 5: you stop opening LinkedIn. you don't know what to say when someone asks what you do.

the stat measures time. it doesn't measure what that time costs you.

**[end card]**: if you're in it right now — follow. I write words for this.

---

#### TikTok B-4: "layoffs hit 150,000+ in 2025"
**Duration**: 20 sec
**Format**: text on screen, stat → feeling
**Hook (first 1.5 sec)**: **"150,000+ tech workers laid off in 2025."** (large text)
**Audio**: ambient

**[text on screen]**

150,000+ tech workers laid off in 2025.

that's 150,000 people who cleared their desk, returned a laptop via FedEx, and texted their partner "we need to talk."

that's 150,000 people pretending they're fine at dinner.

you're not a statistic. you're a person carrying something heavy. and you're allowed to put it down for a second.

**[end card]**: free grounding practice — link in bio

---

#### TikTok B-5: "60% of laid-off workers report identity crisis"
**Duration**: 20 sec
**Format**: text on screen, stat → emotional punch
**Hook (first 1.5 sec)**: **"60% of laid-off workers say they experienced an identity crisis."** (large text)
**Audio**: piano, slow

**[text on screen]**

60% of laid-off workers say they experienced an identity crisis.

the other 40% probably just didn't have words for it yet.

because it's not "just losing a job." it's losing the answer to "so what do you do?"

it's losing the person people came to for answers.

it's losing the you that you spent a decade building.

that's not a career setback. that's grief.

**[end card]**: grounding words for the unnamed thing — @luminouspulse.co

---

### Category C: "Which One Sounds Like You" / Naming Videos (5 scripts)

*Format: fast text, emotional specificity. TikTok duet/stitch-friendly. these name the feeling with surgical precision.*

---

#### TikTok C-1: "which one are you tonight"
**Duration**: 20 sec
**Format**: text on screen, each option appears fast (1.5 sec per line). dark background.
**Hook (first 1 sec)**: "be honest. which one are you tonight?"
**Audio**: lo-fi ambient, slow

**[text on screen, fast reveal]**

be honest. which one are you tonight?

a) scrolling job boards knowing it won't help but can't stop
b) staring at the ceiling rehearsing conversations that haven't happened
c) pretending to watch something while actually spiraling
d) all of the above at the same time

**[hold 2 sec]**

whichever one — you're not the only one awake right now.

**[end card]**: save this. come back tomorrow night.

---

#### TikTok C-2: "the four faces of 'I'm fine'"
**Duration**: 25 sec
**Format**: text on screen, each "face" appears one at a time
**Hook (first 1 sec)**: "the four faces of 'I'm fine' after a layoff:"
**Audio**: soft piano

**[text on screen]**

the four faces of "I'm fine" after a layoff:

1. "I'm actually excited for what's next" (translation: I'm terrified but can't say it)

2. "I needed this break honestly" (translation: I didn't choose this)

3. "I'm exploring my options" (translation: I have no idea what I'm doing)

4. "it's been good for me" (translation: I cried in the shower this morning)

you don't have to be fine. you can just be honest.

**[end card]**: follow @luminouspulse.co

---

#### TikTok C-3: "tell me you got laid off without telling me"
**Duration**: 20 sec
**Format**: text on screen, rapid-fire list. trending format adaptation.
**Hook (first 1 sec)**: "tell me you got laid off without telling me:"
**Audio**: trending, paced

**[text on screen, fast]**

tell me you got laid off without telling me:

you check your old Slack channels from your personal phone.

you said "I'm taking some time" three months ago.

you still have your work laptop bag but nothing to put in it.

you rehearse "I'm in transition" before every social event.

your therapist knows your former manager's name.

**[hold]**

if you're nodding — this account is for you.

**[end card]**: @luminouspulse.co

---

#### TikTok C-4: "the five stages nobody told you about"
**Duration**: 25 sec
**Format**: text on screen, numbered list with emotional punches
**Hook (first 1 sec)**: "the 5 stages of job loss nobody talks about:"
**Audio**: ambient, building slowly

**[text on screen]**

the 5 stages of job loss nobody talks about:

1. the numbness. you refresh your email 40 times a day waiting for it to be a mistake.

2. the performance. you tell everyone you're fine. you convince yourself too.

3. the comparison spiral. everyone on LinkedIn is "thrilled to announce."

4. the identity collapse. someone asks what you do and your mouth just... stops.

5. the unnamed thing. you don't know what to call it. but your body does.

**[end card]**: I write words for stage 5. follow if you're there.

---

#### TikTok C-5: "which feeling woke you up tonight"
**Duration**: 15 sec
**Format**: dark screen, text appears one feeling at a time
**Hook (first 1 sec)**: "which feeling woke you up tonight?"
**Audio**: quiet ambient or silence

**[text, slow reveal, dark background]**

which feeling woke you up tonight?

the dread.

the math.

the shame.

the "what if this is it."

the "I used to be someone."

whichever one — put your hand on your chest. breathe. you're still here.

**[end card]**: free grounding practice — link in bio

### Category D: Grounding Technique Demos (5 scripts)

*Format: show + teach a specific technique. immediate value. save-worthy. sam can use this tonight.*

---

#### TikTok D-1: "the physiological sigh"
**Duration**: 25 sec
**Format**: text + demonstration (talking head or text-only version)
**Hook (first 1 sec)**: "your nervous system has an off switch. here it is."
**Audio**: silence or very quiet ambient

**[text on screen]**

your nervous system has an off switch. here it is.

the physiological sigh:

1. breathe in through your nose.
2. at the top, take one more small inhale. (double inhale)
3. long, slow exhale through your mouth.

that double inhale reinflates the alveoli in your lungs. the long exhale activates your parasympathetic nervous system.

one rep. that's all you need.

your heart rate just dropped.

**[end card]**: save this for before the interview. or right now.

---

#### TikTok D-2: "box breathing for the 3am spiral"
**Duration**: 25 sec
**Format**: text on screen with visual timing. dark background.
**Hook (first 1 sec)**: "navy SEALs use this to stay calm under fire. you can use it at 3am."
**Audio**: silence

**[text on screen, timed]**

navy SEALs use this to stay calm under fire. you can use it at 3am.

box breathing:

in for 4... (pause)
hold for 4... (pause)
out for 4... (pause)
hold for 4... (pause)

try it with me right now.

in... 2... 3... 4...
hold... 2... 3... 4...
out... 2... 3... 4...
hold... 2... 3... 4...

notice your shoulders just dropped.

**[end card]**: save this. use it tonight. @luminouspulse.co

---

#### TikTok D-3: "the butterfly hug"
**Duration**: 20 sec
**Format**: demonstration (talking head showing technique) or text on screen
**Hook (first 1 sec)**: "therapists teach this to people after trauma. it takes 30 seconds."
**Audio**: very soft ambient

**[text on screen or speaking]**

therapists teach this to people after trauma. it takes 30 seconds.

the butterfly hug:

cross your arms. place your hands on your shoulders.

now alternate tapping. left, right, left, right.

slow, gentle, rhythmic.

this is bilateral stimulation. it calms the amygdala.

keep going for 30 seconds.

notice the shift.

**[end card]**: save this for the waiting room. or the car. or the couch at 2am.

---

#### TikTok D-4: "the cold reset"
**Duration**: 15 sec
**Format**: text on screen, fast and simple
**Hook (first 1 sec)**: "anxiety through the roof? here's a 10-second nervous system hack."
**Audio**: quiet

**[text on screen]**

anxiety through the roof? 10-second reset:

cold water on your wrists. hold for 10 seconds.

or: splash cold water on your face.

or: hold an ice cube.

the cold activates the mammalian dive reflex. your heart rate drops. your breathing slows. your body tells your brain: you're safe.

use this before the phone call. before the interview. before the email.

**[end card]**: save this. @luminouspulse.co

---

#### TikTok D-5: "5-4-3-2-1 for the interview waiting room"
**Duration**: 25 sec
**Format**: text on screen, calm and specific
**Hook (first 1 sec)**: "you have 5 minutes before the interview. do this."
**Audio**: quiet piano

**[text on screen]**

you have 5 minutes before the interview. do this.

sit in the chair. feet flat on the floor.

5 things you can see in this room.
4 textures you can feel (chair, pants, phone, table).
3 sounds (air vent, voices, your own breathing).
2 things you can smell.
1 thing you can taste.

you're in the room. not in your head.

now walk in. you're ready.

**[end card]**: "before the room" — a grounding guide for the 30 minutes before. link in bio.

7. "that moment when you rehearse 'I'm in transition' before a party."
8. "scrolling job boards at 2am knowing it won't help but can't stop."

## 4. Audio & Trend Notes

### Recommended Audio Types for TikTok

Based on `instagram-reels-audio-strategy-2026.md` and TikTok-specific trends:

**Primary audio style: quiet ambient / silence + text**
- Most stat-response and naming videos work best with minimal audio
- Silence + text is a TikTok format that performs well for emotional content
- Lets the words hit without distraction

**Secondary: soft piano / lo-fi instrumentals**
- "Carefree Days" — calm aesthetic, works cross-platform
- Soft piano loops — trending for vulnerability content on TikTok
- Lo-fi bedroom beats — matches the 2am energy

**Tertiary: nostalgic emotional tracks**
- "Only Time" by Enya — cinematic, slow, used for relatable struggles
- Taylor Swift "Fortnight" — "all my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February" lyric resonates
- "Iris" by Goo Goo Dolls — trending for emotional storytelling, before/after transformations

**Voiceover note**: original audio gets algorithmic preference on both TikTok and IG in 2026. for talking head videos, use your voice as primary audio with quiet instrumental underneath. this also helps with cross-posting — original audio avoids the IG watermark penalty.

**TikTok-specific notes**:
- TikTok original sounds trend faster and die faster than IG — check trending tab weekly
- Trending sounds on TikTok often arrive on IG 1-2 weeks later — use this to predict IG trends
- For text-on-screen videos, trending audio boosts reach even if the audio is quiet/background
- Save 5-10 trending sounds per week while scrolling — build a library

### Audio Do's and Don'ts

| do | don't |
|----|-------|
| silence + text for stat videos | high-energy/hustle audio |
| soft piano for naming content | sped-up remixes |
| voiceover + quiet instrumental | dance/flex content audio |
| trending sounds as quiet background | anything with aggressive energy |
| binaural beats for grounding demos | motivational speaker audio clips |

## 7. Cross-Posting Notes

- **TikTok-first, IG-second**: film for TikTok (vertical, fast hooks). repost to IG Reels with minor adjustments (soften the hook by 1 beat, IG audience responds to slightly slower pacing).
- **Never repost TikTok to IG with the TikTok watermark** — IG penalizes this heavily. use a watermark-free export or film natively on both.
- **Trending audio strategy**: check TikTok trending sounds weekly. sounds that trend on TikTok often arrive on IG 1-2 weeks later. early adoption = algorithmic boost on IG.
- **Duets and stitches**: when a layoff stat or career grief video goes viral on TikTok, stitch it with a grounding response. this is the stat-response format in real time.
