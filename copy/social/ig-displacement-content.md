## 1. New Carousel Scripts (5 carousels, 7-10 slides each)

---

### Carousel D-1: "what month 6 of unemployment actually looks like"

**Pillar**: Name the Feeling
**Style**: stat-response — open with a cold stat, then name the feeling underneath
**Post time**: 9pm-12am

**Slide 1 (Hook)**
1 in 4 unemployed Americans
have been looking for 6+ months.

here's what the stat doesn't tell you.

**Slide 2**
month 1: you update the resume.
you tell people it's exciting.
you believe it.

**Slide 3**
month 2: the first silence.
applications go out. nothing comes back.
you start checking your email 40 times a day.

**Slide 4**
month 3: the performance.
you stop telling people you're unemployed.
you say "I'm exploring."

**Slide 5**
month 4: the comparison spiral.
everyone on LinkedIn is "thrilled to announce."
you can't even open the app anymore.

**Slide 6**
month 5: the identity collapse.
someone asks what you do
and your mouth just... stops.

**Slide 7**
month 6: the unnamed thing.
you don't know what to call it.
but your body knows.
it's heavier in the morning. quieter at night.
it lives in the space between "I'm fine" and the truth.

**Slide 8 (Affirmation)**
"I am not behind.
there is no schedule for grief.
I am not a statistic.
I am a person carrying something heavy.
and I'm allowed to set it down."

**Slide 9 (CTA)**
if you're in it right now —
save this.
send it to someone who is.
or just sit with it for a second.

### Carousel D-2: "5 things nobody tells you about getting laid off"

**Pillar**: Name the Feeling
**Post time**: 9pm-12am

**Slide 1 (Hook)**
5 things nobody tells you
about getting laid off

**Slide 2**
1. the grief is real.

it doesn't matter that "it's just a job."
you lost a role, a team, a daily rhythm,
and a version of yourself.
that's grief. call it what it is.

**Slide 3**
2. "you'll find something better" is the loneliest thing anyone can say.

because what you actually need
is for someone to sit with you
in the not knowing.

**Slide 4**
3. the shame is heavier than the loss.

the feeling that you should be handling this better.
that other people bounce back faster.
that needing help for "just a job" is embarrassing.

**Slide 5**
4. the hardest question isn't "what's next?"

it's "who am I now?"

your title, your team, your calendar,
your answer to "so what do you do?" — gone.
and underneath it: a stranger.

**Slide 6**
5. the rebuilding doesn't start with a resume.

it starts with a breath.
and then another.
and then one honest sentence
about how you actually feel.

**Slide 7 (Affirmation)**
"I am whole without a title.
the people who love me
didn't love my LinkedIn headline.
my competence didn't evaporate
when my role did."

**Slide 8 (CTA)**
save this for the hard morning.
send it to someone who hasn't said it out loud yet.

free grounding practice — link in bio.
printable. private. no app. just you and a pen.

### Carousel D-3: "the identity crisis nobody talks about"

**Pillar**: Name the Feeling
**Style**: naming the feeling behind the stat. emotional depth.
**Post time**: 10pm-12am

**Slide 1 (Hook)**
60% of laid-off workers report
an identity crisis.

the other 40% probably just
didn't have words for it yet.

**Slide 2**
it starts the moment someone asks
"so what do you do?"
and you realize your answer
is in past tense.

**Slide 3**
it's not just the job.
it's the person you were inside that job.

the one people came to for answers.
the one who had a plan.
the one who held it together.

**Slide 4**
and now you're sitting on the couch at 2am
trying to remember who you are
underneath the title that's gone.

**Slide 5**
this is the crisis nobody talks about.

not a skills gap. not a resume problem.

an identity gap.

the distance between who you were
and who you're becoming —
and the terrifying silence in between.

**Slide 6**
here's what I want you to know:

the silence doesn't mean you're broken.
it means you're in the space
between two versions of yourself.

and that space — the in-between —
is where the real work happens.

**Slide 7 (Affirmation)**
"I don't know who I am right now.
and that is not a failure.
it is the beginning of something
I haven't met yet."

**Slide 8 (CTA)**
if you're in the in-between right now —
this is for you.

save it. or send it to the person
who says "I'm fine" but you know isn't.

"who am I without the title?" — a 49-page workbook
for exactly this feeling. link in bio.

### Carousel D-4: "you don't have to be 'over it'"

**Pillar**: Permission
**Style**: permission carousel. quiet, tender, direct.
**Post time**: 9pm

**Slide 1 (Hook)**
you don't have to be "over it."

(consider this your permission slip.)

**Slide 2**
you don't have to be "over it"
on someone else's timeline.

grief doesn't follow a calendar.
not even the one
your well-meaning friends set for you.

**Slide 3**
you don't have to pretend
the severance softened the blow.

money is not medicine
for the part of you
that doesn't know who it is anymore.

**Slide 4**
you don't have to be grateful
for "the opportunity to start fresh"
when you didn't ask to start over.

**Slide 5**
you don't have to be brave.
you don't have to be inspiring.
you don't have to turn this into a story yet.

you can just be in it.

**Slide 6**
you don't have to have a plan.

"I don't know" is a complete sentence.
"I'm not okay" is a brave one.

**Slide 7 (Affirmation)**
"I give myself permission
to not be over it.
to not have a plan.
to feel this without a deadline.

my timeline is mine."

**Slide 8 (CTA)**
save your permission slip.
it doesn't expire.

free grounding practice — link in bio.
for the nights you need it most.

### Carousel D-5: "where are you right now?" (the prescription carousel)

**Pillar**: Soft Sell / Prescription
**Style**: maps 4 feelings to 4 workbooks. each slide is a different entry point. tells Sam which one.
**Post time**: 9pm

**Slide 1 (Hook)**
where are you right now?

(be honest. then I'll tell you
where to start.)

**Slide 2**
"I just got the news and I can't breathe."

you need: "before the room" — a 28-page grounding guide
for the 30 minutes before the hard thing.
evidence-based nervous system techniques
that actually lower your heart rate.
$9.

**Slide 3**
"I'm grieving and I don't know what to do with it."

you need: "tender landings" — 44 pages
for naming what hurts, writing the letters
you'll never send, and finding what remains.
for the version of you
that's still in the thick of it.
$12.

**Slide 4**
"I don't know who I am anymore."

you need: "who am I without the title?" — 49 pages
of excavating who you are underneath the title.
8 guided exercises for rebuilding identity
from the inside out.
$15.

**Slide 5**
"I need a daily practice to hold onto."

you need: "30 days of ground" — 66 pages.
one page. one prompt. one breath.
every day for 30 days.
the daily rhythm for when everything else
feels unsteady.
$17.

**Slide 6**
"I need all of it."

the complete grounding collection:
all 8 workbooks. 404 pages. $47.
grief. identity. daily practice. interviews.
the slow rebuild. everything.

67% less than buying individually.

**Slide 7 (Bridge)**
you don't need all of them.
you need the one
that matches where you are right now.

start there. one workbook. one feeling. one breath.

**Slide 8 (CTA)**
save this for when you're ready.
link in bio.
printable. private. offline.
just you and a pen.

## 2. New Reel Scripts (5 reels, 30-60 sec each)

---

### Reel D-1: "the 2am scroll"
**Duration**: 45-60 sec
**Format**: talking to camera at night, low light, quiet. phone-lit face. intimate.
**Audio**: near-silence or very soft ambient. voiceover if not on camera.
**Post time**: 11pm-1am
**Pillar**: You Are Not Alone

**[you, on the couch, dim light, speaking quietly]**

it's late. you're on the couch. partner's asleep.

you told yourself you'd go to bed an hour ago but here you are. scrolling. not looking for anything specific. just... here.

and somewhere between a recipe video and someone's engagement announcement, the thing you've been pushing down all day comes up.

you don't even know what to call it. it's not sadness exactly. it's not anger. it's this heavy, unnamed thing that sits on your chest and says: *who are you now?*

I know that feeling. and I want you to know: you don't have to answer that question tonight.

tonight, you just have to breathe. put your hand on your chest. feel your heartbeat. that's the proof you're still here.

and that's enough for tonight.

**[end card]**: follow @luminouspulse.co for more like this.

**Caption**: you're awake. I know. this is for you. right now. save it for tomorrow night too.

### Reel D-2: "I got laid off and here's what actually helped"
**Duration**: 45-60 sec
**Format**: talking head, personal story, natural light. raw, not polished.
**Audio**: quiet instrumental underneath or just voice
**Post time**: 9pm
**Pillar**: Ground Yourself

**[you, speaking to camera]**

I want to tell you what actually helped when everything fell apart. not what LinkedIn says. not "network harder." what actually helped.

one — I stopped telling everyone I was fine. I found one person and said "I'm not okay." just saying it out loud made it smaller.

two — I bought a notebook. not a planner. not a goal-setting journal. a blank notebook. and every night I wrote one honest sentence about how I actually felt. just one.

three — I learned to breathe on purpose. not meditation. not an app. just: in for 4, hold for 4, out for 6. before the interview. after the rejection. at 2am.

four — I stopped comparing my timeline to everyone else's. "I'm behind" is a lie your panic tells you. there is no schedule for rebuilding.

five — I let it be grief. I stopped calling it a "career transition" and called it what it was. and weirdly, that's when it started to get lighter.

that's it. no framework. no five-step plan. just five small things that made the worst of it bearable.

**[end card]**: free grounding practice — link in bio.

**Caption**: the things that helped weren't the things anyone recommended. they were the quiet ones. save this for the day you need one of these.

### Reel D-3: "the stat and the feeling" (stat-response reel)
**Duration**: 30 sec
**Format**: text on screen. stat appears bold and large. feeling text fades in quietly underneath.
**Audio**: soft piano or "Only Time" by Enya
**Post time**: 10pm
**Pillar**: Name the Feeling

**[text on screen]**

**1 in 4 unemployed Americans have been looking for 6+ months.**

(hold 3 sec)

but here's what the stat doesn't measure:

(fade in, slow)

the shame of not knowing what to say at a dinner party.

the way you check your email 40 times
before noon and it's never the one you need.

the distance between "I'm fine"
and the truth.

(hold)

you are not a data point.
you are a person.
and what you're carrying is real.

**[end card]**: follow @luminouspulse.co — grounding for the unnamed thing.

**Caption**: the stat is cold. the feeling isn't. if you know someone in it right now, send this.

### Reel D-4: "which one sounds like you?"
**Duration**: 20-25 sec
**Format**: text on screen, fast cuts, each option appears for 2 sec. dark background.
**Audio**: lo-fi ambient or quiet trending audio
**Post time**: 10pm
**Pillar**: Name the Feeling

**[text on screen, fast reveal]**

which one sounds like you right now?

a) "I don't know who I am without the job"

b) "I'm grieving but I feel stupid saying that about a job"

c) "I keep telling everyone I'm fine"

d) "I have an interview and my hands won't stop shaking"

**[hold 2 sec]**

a → you need identity work.
b → you need to name it.
c → you need permission.
d → you need grounding.

**[end card]**: whichever one — free grounding practice in bio. or DM me "mine" and I'll send you the right starting point.

**Caption**: be honest. save this. come back when you're ready. no rush.

### Reel D-5: "grounding for the interview waiting room"
**Duration**: 30-40 sec
**Format**: text on screen, calm and specific. or talking head, quiet voice.
**Audio**: silence or very quiet ambient. let the technique breathe.
**Post time**: friday 9pm (interview prep day)
**Pillar**: Ground Yourself

**[text on screen, slow]**

you're in the parking lot.
or the lobby.
or the bathroom stall.

your hands are doing that thing.
your heart is doing that thing.

here's what to do in the next 3 minutes:

1. cold water on your wrists. hold for 10 seconds.
(the mammalian dive reflex. it lowers your heart rate.)

2. double inhale through your nose. long exhale through your mouth.
(the physiological sigh. one rep is enough.)

3. feet flat on the floor.
name 5 things you can see in this room.

you're here now. not in your head.

4. one sentence: "I am prepared. I am enough. I am here."

now walk in.

**[end card]**: "before the room" — a 28-page grounding guide for this exact moment. link in bio. $9.

**Caption**: for the person with an interview this week — save this. screenshot it. put it in your pocket. you're ready.

## 3. New Quote Card Captions (10)

*All displacement/identity focused. no human-vs-AI framing.*

---

### Naming Hooks (5 — hyper-specific emotional moments)

---

#### QC-N1: "the rehearsal"

**Quote card text**: "the way you rehearse 'I'm in transition' before every social event."

**Caption**:
the worst part isn't saying it.
it's the half-second before, where you decide which version of "fine" to perform tonight.

you're not performing for them. you're performing for the version of you that still thinks needing help is weakness.

it's not weakness. it's grief wearing a nice shirt.

save this for before the next event. or send it to someone who always says "I'm good."
.
.
.
#displacedworker #layoffrecovery #careergrief #mentalhealth #2amthoughts #groundingpractice

---

#### QC-N2: "the empty calendar"

**Quote card text**: "the silence after you close the laptop and there's nothing to do and nowhere to be."

**Caption**:
nobody warns you about the silence.

when the meetings stop, and the Slack notifications stop, and the calendar is just... blank.

at first you think: this is freedom.
then you think: this is terrifying.
then you stop thinking and just feel it — this hollow, echoing quiet where your purpose used to live.

you're not lazy. you're not failing. you're adjusting to a silence you never asked for.

save this for the quiet afternoon.
.
.
.
#displacedworker #layoffrecovery #careergrief #identitycrisis #mentalhealth #groundingpractice

---

#### QC-N3: "the LinkedIn scroll"

**Quote card text**: "scrolling job boards at 2am knowing it won't help but not being able to stop."

**Caption**:
the scroll isn't about finding a job. the scroll is about control.

when everything is uncertain, at least this feels like doing something. even at 2am. even when you know the good postings aren't going up at 2am. even when your eyes burn.

the scroll is your anxiety in disguise.

tonight, try this instead: close the app. put your hand on your chest. breathe in for 4, hold for 4, out for 6. one round. then decide if you want to keep scrolling or if you want to rest.

no shame either way.
.
.
.
#2amthoughts #layoffrecovery #displacedworker #mentalhealth #groundingpractice #anxietyrelief

---

#### QC-N4: "the dinner question"

**Quote card text**: "the way your chest tightens when someone asks 'so what do you do now?'"

**Caption**:
it's the "now" that gets you.

not "what do you do?" you used to love that question.

"what do you do *now*?"

and in the half-second before you answer, your whole body braces. because the truth is: you don't know. and the version of you that always had the answer — the competent one, the together one — doesn't live here anymore.

this feeling has a name. it's called an identity gap.

and you're not broken for standing in it. you're brave for not pretending it away.
.
.
.
#displacedworker #layoffrecovery #identitycrisis #careergrief #mentalhealth #groundingpractice

---

#### QC-N5: "the 3am math"

**Quote card text**: "lying awake doing the math on your severance at 3am."

**Caption**:
the math at 3am is never just math.

it's "how many months until we can't afford this apartment."
it's "what if I have to take a job I hate."
it's "what if I never get back to where I was."

the numbers are real. I won't pretend they aren't.

but the spiral adds interest that doesn't exist yet. the 3am math includes a future that hasn't happened.

tonight, try this: write down the actual number. the real one. not the spiral one. put it on paper. then close the notebook.

the number on paper is smaller than the number in your head. it always is.

### Permission Hooks (5 — "you don't have to...")

---

#### QC-P1: "you don't have to be grateful"

**Quote card text**: "you don't have to be grateful for the 'opportunity to start fresh.' you didn't ask for this."

**Caption**:
the toxic positivity around layoffs is suffocating.

"everything happens for a reason."
"maybe this is the push you needed."
"you'll look back and be grateful."

no. maybe you won't. and that's allowed.

you're allowed to be angry about a disruption you didn't choose. you're allowed to grieve a role you loved. you're allowed to feel all of this without wrapping it in a silver lining.

gratitude might come later. or it might not. either way, you don't owe anyone a redemption arc.

save this for the next person who says "it's a blessing in disguise."
.
.
.
#layoffrecovery #displacedworker #careergrief #mentalhealth #groundingpractice #permissionslip

---

#### QC-P2: "you don't have to network today"

**Quote card text**: "you don't have to send a single cold email today. you can just exist."

**Caption**:
the job search advice is relentless.

"network every day."
"send 10 applications a day."
"reach out to 5 new people this week."

and some days you will. and some days you'll stare at your laptop for 45 minutes, close it, and lie on the floor.

both of those days count.

you are not your daily application count. you are not your networking rate. you are a person navigating something hard, and some days surviving is the only metric that matters.

save this for the floor day.
.
.
.
#layoffrecovery #displacedworker #mentalhealth #groundingpractice #permissionslip #jobsearch

---

#### QC-P3: "you don't have to explain this to anyone"

**Quote card text**: "you don't owe anyone a narrative about why you were laid off."

**Caption**:
the first thing everyone wants is the story.

"what happened?" "why you?" "what are you going to do?"

and you find yourself crafting an answer that makes it sound clean. logical. maybe even positive.

but the truth doesn't fit in a sentence. the truth is messy and it doesn't have an ending yet and you're tired of performing it for other people.

you don't owe anyone the clean version. "I'm still figuring it out" is enough. "I don't want to talk about it" is enough. silence is enough.

save this for the next time someone asks.
.
.
.
#displacedworker #layoffrecovery #careergrief #mentalhealth #groundingpractice #permissionslip

---

#### QC-P4: "you don't have to be 'over it' by now"

**Quote card text**: "there is no deadline for grief. especially the kind nobody validates."

**Caption**:
people start to get uncomfortable after about 6 weeks.

"are you still... going through that?"
"haven't you applied for anything yet?"
"you seem like you're doing better. right?"

and the real answer — "I cried in the car yesterday because my old team had a lunch without me and I saw it on Instagram" — doesn't fit what they want to hear.

there is no deadline for this. grief about a job is still grief. invisible grief is still grief. grief that makes you feel stupid for having it is still grief.

take as long as you need.
.
.
.
#layoffrecovery #careergrief #displacedworker #mentalhealth #groundingpractice #permissionslip #grief

---

#### QC-P5: "you don't have to turn this into content"

**Quote card text**: "you don't have to monetize your pain. you can just feel it."

**Caption**:
this one's personal.

there's a strange pressure — especially in the creator economy, especially if you're online — to turn everything into a story. a post. a lesson. a "5 things I learned from getting laid off" thread.

and maybe you will. later. when it's yours to shape.

but right now, while you're in it, you don't have to perform your recovery. you don't have to document the rebuilding. you don't have to be useful.

you can just feel it. privately. without an audience.

that's not wasted time. that's healing.

save this for when the pressure to "share your journey" feels suffocating.
