# Pinterest Content Strategy — Luminous Pulse

> **Platform role**: #2 paid channel. Cheapest CPC ($0.10-$1.50). Evergreen discovery engine.
> **Key insight**: Pinterest is a visual SEARCH ENGINE, not a social network. Pin descriptions need SEO keywords, standard capitalization, and clear value props. NOT the quiet lowercase brand voice used on IG.
> **Audience**: 25-44, wellness/self-improvement interest, high purchase intent (83% of weekly users buy from pins). "Printable workbook" and "printable journal" are high-intent search terms.
