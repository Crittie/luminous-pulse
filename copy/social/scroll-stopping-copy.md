# scroll-stopping copy — luminous pulse (march 2026)

> **voice shift**: the original copy was warm. therapeutic. it sounded like every other wellness brand on instagram. sam scrolling at 2am doesn't stop for another "you are worthy" post. sam stops for the thing nobody else is saying out loud.

---

## voice rules

1. **visceral specificity.** not "losing a job is hard." instead: "you gave them 7 years and they gave you a slack message and a fedex label."
2. **earned profanity.** "fuck," "shit," "damn" — when it lands. never at the reader. always at the situation. ~30% of posts.
3. **permission, not positivity.** never "you'll be fine." always "you don't have to be fine."
4. **naming, not fixing.** name the feeling sam can't articulate. the naming IS the value.
5. **anti-bullshit.** call out "just upskill," "everything happens for a reason," "bounce back," "pivot." our audience hates this advice. so do we.
6. **lowercase always.** the brand voice is 2am, kitchen table, pen in hand. not a billboard.
7. **we're WITH them, not above them.** this isn't a wellness practitioner talking to a patient. it's someone who's been through it talking to someone who's in it.

### content mix:
- 30% raw with profanity (scroll-stoppers)
- 40% raw without profanity (naming, specificity)
- 30% tender/grounding (breathwork, technique, gentle)

### faceless format:
all content = text-on-screen, graphics, animated text. no face. no voice. the brand is the words, not a person.

## hooks library (40 scroll-stoppers)

> the first line people see. if this doesn't stop the scroll, nothing else matters.

### permission hooks
1. you don't have to apply to shit today.
2. you don't owe anyone a comeback story.
3. you're allowed to be angry about this for as long as you need.
4. you don't have to know what's next. you just have to get through tonight.
5. you're allowed to grieve a job. even if nobody sends flowers for it.
6. you don't have to be brave about this. you can just be honest.
7. it's okay that you can't explain what you're feeling right now.
8. you don't have to turn this into a growth opportunity.
9. rest is not quitting. rest is surviving.
10. you're allowed to need help. even if you've always been the one who helps.

### naming hooks
11. the way your chest tightens when someone asks "so what do you do now?"
12. scrolling job boards at 2am knowing it won't help but not being able to stop.
13. the silence after you close the laptop and there's nothing to do and nowhere to be.
14. telling everyone you're fine. knowing you're not. not knowing what to call the thing in between.
15. the weird guilt of being sad about a job when other people have "real" problems.
16. the way a rejection email can ruin a whole week and you feel pathetic for it.
17. refreshing linkedin at 2am and hating yourself for it.
18. the moment your kid asks "are you going to work today?" and you don't know what to say.
19. performing okayness at the coffee shop while your savings drain.
20. the specific loneliness of being next to your partner and feeling completely alone in this.

### raw / anti-bullshit hooks
21. nobody fucking tells you that losing your job feels like a breakup.
22. "just upskill" — the most useless advice from people who've never been laid off.
23. "everything happens for a reason" is something people say when they still have a paycheck.
24. you gave them everything and they gave you a slack message and a fedex label.
25. if one more person says "this is your chance to reinvent yourself."
26. the job market isn't tough. it's broken. stop blaming yourself.
27. 200 applications. zero callbacks. and somehow YOUR resume is the problem?
28. "at least you got severance." cool. that really helps with the identity crisis.
29. they laid off 800 people in one email. let that sink in.
30. the people telling you to "stay positive" have no idea what 3am feels like.

### contradiction hooks
31. everyone on linkedin is "excited to announce." nobody posts "I cried in the shower this morning."
32. they want you to "bounce back" like you're a tennis ball and not a human being.
33. you're supposed to be optimistic in interviews and honest in therapy and nobody talks about the whiplash.
34. society wants you grateful for the "opportunity" and devastated at the same time. pick a lane.

### 2am hooks
35. you're awake. I know.
36. the 2am version of you deserves someone who doesn't pretend this is fine.
37. for the ones reading this when they should be sleeping.
38. if you're scrolling this at 2am, this is for you specifically.
39. the night is louder when you don't know who you are anymore.
40. can't sleep? me neither. here's one thing.

## quote cards — month 1 (20 posts)

> posts 1-9 are grid seeds. post them march 7-9 (the weekend before launch) to fill the grid. posts 10-20 are your first weeks of scheduled content.

---

### post 1 (grid seed)
**card text:** you don't have to apply to shit today.

**caption:** or tomorrow. or until your hands stop shaking.

the job hunt isn't going anywhere. but your nervous system needs a minute.

this account is for the version of you that's up at 2am, not talking about it, pretending you're fine. you don't have to be fine here.

save this for a monday morning when the guilt hits.

#laidoff #jobsearch #grounding

---

### post 2 (grid seed)
**card text:** nobody sends flowers when you lose a job. but it's still grief.

**caption:** real grief. for a role, a team, a routine, a version of yourself that's gone.

and everyone around you treats it like a problem to solve instead of something to mourn.

it's not a problem. it's a loss. and you're allowed to feel it.

save this. send it to someone who needs to hear it.

#careergrief #layoff #displacedworker

---

### post 3 (grid seed)
**card text:** the hardest part isn't finding a new job. it's remembering who you are without one.

**caption:** nobody prepared you for the identity crisis. they prepared you for the job search.

but the job search isn't why you're up at 2am. the question "who am I now?" is.

that question is worth sitting with. not rushing past.

#identitycrisis #layoffs #growyourself

---

### post 4 (grid seed)
**card text:** 200 applications. radio silence. you're not the problem.

**caption:** the market is broken. the hiring process is broken. the ATS that rejected you in 0.3 seconds is broken.

you are not broken.

save this for the next time a rejection email makes you question everything.

#jobmarket #jobsearchstruggles #layoff2026

---

### post 5 (grid seed)
**card text:** your worth was set long before your badge was taken.

**caption:** before the title. before the team. before the salary that made you feel like you'd made it.

your worth was set the day you showed up as a human being. no company gave it to you. no layoff can take it.

save this. you'll need it.

#layoffrecovery #selfworth #grounding

---

### post 6 (grid seed)
**card text:** you don't owe anyone a comeback story.

**caption:** you don't owe linkedin a "thrilled to announce." you don't owe your parents an update. you don't owe your friends optimism.

you owe yourself the truth: this hurts. and the hurt is allowed to take as long as it takes.

#laidoff #honesthope #grounding

---

### post 7 (grid seed)
**card text:** it's okay to be angry. they chose a spreadsheet over you.

**caption:** you can be angry and sad and scared and hopeful all at the same time. that's not confusion. that's being human during something inhumane.

don't let anyone rush you past the anger. it has something to tell you.

#layoffs #workplaceculture #careerchange

---

### post 8 (grid seed)
**card text:** "everything happens for a reason" is something people say when they still have a paycheck.

**caption:** here's the truth: sometimes things happen for no good reason. sometimes the reason is a quarterly earnings call.

you're allowed to be pissed about that without wrapping it in a silver lining.

what actually helps isn't a reason. it's a witness. someone who says "yeah. this is shit. I'm here."

that's what we do here. save this.

#toxicpositivity #layoff #realrecovery

---

### post 9 (grid seed)
**card text:** the "what do you do?" question hits different when you don't have an answer.

**caption:** the dinner parties. the small talk. the way your stomach drops when someone asks the question you used to answer without thinking.

you are more than your answer to that question. you always were.

it just took losing the easy answer to realize the real one was always underneath.

#careeridentity #displacedworker #grounding

---

### post 10
**card text:** you're not lazy. you're grieving.

**caption:** "why can't I just get up and apply?" because your body is processing a loss your brain hasn't caught up to yet.

grief makes you tired. grief makes you foggy. grief makes you stare at the wall for an hour and not remember what you were supposed to be doing.

that's not laziness. that's your nervous system doing its job.

be gentle with yourself today.

#grief #layoffrecovery #mentalhealth

---

### post 11
**card text:** somebody needs to say this: the job market is fucked right now. it's not you.

**caption:** 873 tech workers laid off per day in early 2026. 200+ applications per opening. AI screening your resume before a human sees it.

and somehow you're supposed to "stay positive"?

the system is broken. you're doing your best inside a broken system. don't internalize a structural problem as a personal failure.

#techlayoffs #jobmarket2026 #displaced

---

### post 12
**card text:** the worst part isn't the layoff. it's the tuesday after. and the one after that.

**caption:** the first week everyone checks on you. by the second week they've moved on. by the fourth week you're carrying it alone and everyone thinks you're fine.

the quiet aftermath is the hardest part. nobody warns you about it.

if you're in the quiet aftermath right now — I see you.

#layoffaftermath #silentstruggle #grounding

---

### post 13
**card text:** you can apply for jobs AND fall apart. both can be true.

**caption:** you don't have to pick one. you don't have to be "in a good headspace" to send an application. and you don't have to be productive to be allowed to feel.

both things. same day. same hour, even.

you're not contradicting yourself. you're being human.

#jobsearch #mentalhealth #realtalk

---

### post 14
**card text:** the "I'm fine" era is exhausting. you don't have to keep it up here.

**caption:** in the interview: "I'm excited for new opportunities."
at dinner: "it's been great. time to figure things out."
at 2am: ...

this is a space for the 2am version of you. the real one.

you don't have to perform anything here.

#authenticity #layoff #safespace

---

### post 15
**card text:** grief doesn't care that it was "just a job." your body knows the truth.

**caption:** your body doesn't distinguish between types of loss. a breakup, a death, a layoff — your nervous system processes all of them the same way.

so when your chest tightens and your sleep shatters — that's not weakness. that's biology.

your body is doing exactly what it's supposed to. trust it.

#grief #nervoussystem #careergrief

---

### post 16
**card text:** hand on chest. breathe in 4. hold 4. out 6. you're still here.

**caption:** that's it. that's the post.

try it right now. wherever you are. even if you feel nothing. even if you feel everything.

your nervous system will thank you.

save this for 2am.

#breathwork #grounding #anxiety

---

### post 17
**card text:** you showed up today. in the mess of it. that counts.

**caption:** you didn't solve it. you didn't fix it. you didn't get the callback or the offer or the clarity.

but you got through another day. you ate something. you breathed. you're reading this.

the bar doesn't have to be high right now. existing in this is enough.

#recovery #selfcompassion #grounding

---

### post 18
**card text:** stop comparing your chapter 1 to someone else's chapter 20.

**caption:** the person who just posted "excited to announce" probably cried in their car last month. you're seeing their highlight reel from your lowest point.

your timeline is yours. it doesn't have to look like anyone else's.

#comparison #linkedin #career

---

### post 19
**card text:** "just upskill" — said by someone who's never lost their identity in a single email.

**caption:** the advice isn't wrong. it's just tone-deaf when you're in the middle of an identity crisis you didn't ask for.

before you upskill, you need to know who you are underneath the skills.

that's the work nobody talks about. that's the work we make workbooks for.

link in bio if you need it. no pressure.

#upskilling #careeradvice #identitycrisis

---

### post 20
**card text:** you don't need to "bounce back." you need to breathe first.

**caption:** everyone wants the comeback montage. nobody wants the messy middle.

but the messy middle is where the real work happens. not the job search — the identity work. naming what actually hurts. giving yourself permission to feel it.

that's what a grounding practice is for. not to fix you. to hold you while you figure it out.

free 5-day practice — link in bio.

## carousels — month 1 (4 scripts)

---

### carousel 1: "what nobody fucking tells you about losing your job"

**slide 1 (hook):**
what nobody fucking tells you about losing your job

**slide 2:**
that it's grief.
actual grief.
and you'll feel insane for calling it that about a job.

**slide 3:**
that "what do you do?" becomes the scariest question in the english language.

**slide 4:**
that you'll refresh linkedin at 2am and hate yourself for it.

**slide 5:**
that the shame is worse than the loss.
the feeling you should be handling this better.

**slide 6:**
that "you'll find something better" is the loneliest sentence anyone can say to you right now.

**slide 7:**
that the rebuilding doesn't start with a resume.
it starts with naming what actually hurts.

**slide 8 (CTA):**
save this for the next time someone tells you to "stay positive."

free grounding practice — link in bio.
@luminouspulse.co

**caption:** this is for the thing nobody warned you about. not the job search. the identity crisis that comes before it.

if this hit, save it. or send it to someone who's carrying this right now.

### carousel 2: "5 things your body does after a layoff that nobody talks about"

**slide 1 (hook):**
5 things your body does after a layoff that nobody talks about

**slide 2:**
the jaw clenching.
you're holding tension you don't even realize is there.

**slide 3:**
the 3am wake-ups.
your nervous system is stuck in threat mode.

**slide 4:**
the chest tightness when you open email.
your body remembers the slack message before your brain does.

**slide 5:**
the exhaustion from doing nothing.
grief is the most tiring thing you'll ever do.

**slide 6:**
the appetite thing — eating everything or eating nothing.
both are the same signal.

**slide 7:**
your body is keeping score.
it processed the layoff before your brain caught up.
that's not weakness. that's biology.

**slide 8 (CTA):**
one thing for right now:
hand on chest. breathe in 4. hold 4. out 6.

save this. share it. or just breathe.
@luminouspulse.co

**caption:** your body is doing exactly what it's supposed to after a loss. the problem isn't your body. it's that nobody told you this would happen.

neuroscience shows handwriting activates emotional processing centers that typing can't reach. that's why we make printable grounding workbooks — paper and pen, not apps and subscriptions.

### carousel 3: "if one more person says 'everything happens for a reason'"

**slide 1 (hook):**
if one more person says "everything happens for a reason"

**slide 2:**
the reason was a quarterly earnings call.
not the universe. a spreadsheet.

**slide 3:**
the people who say it still have paychecks.
funny how that works.

**slide 4:**
the people who say "you'll bounce back" have never stared at a ceiling at 3am wondering who they are anymore.

**slide 5:**
the people who say "at least you got severance" have no idea what a ticking clock feels like.

**slide 6:**
what would actually help:
"I see you. this is hard. I'm not going to fix it."

**slide 7:**
what would actually help:
"you don't have to be okay right now. I'm just here."

**slide 8 (CTA):**
you don't need a reason.
you need a witness.

that's what this space is for.
save this. send it to someone.
@luminouspulse.co

**caption:** the toxic positivity industrial complex has done more damage to displaced workers than any layoff.

the pressure to "stay positive" when your identity just imploded isn't strength. it's suppression.

you're allowed to feel every single thing you're feeling. all of it. right here.

be honest about which slide you stopped on.
that's the one.

all printable. all offline. just you and a pen.
@luminouspulse.co — link in bio

### reel 1: "you're awake" (15 sec)

[dark background. text appears slowly, one line at a time. ambient audio.]

you're awake.
I know.
here's one thing.
hand on chest.
in for 4.
hold for 4.

week 4: "the market is tough right now."
week 8: "am I even qualified for anything?"
week 12: "who am I without this?"
week 16: you stop counting.

nobody talks about week 16.
we talk about week 16.

**caption:** the timeline nobody prepares you for. if you're past "I'll find something fast" and into "who am I?" — that's where our workbooks live. save this.

---

### reel 3: "what they say vs what you need" (25 sec)

[text alternates. "they say" in gray, "you need" in white/cream.]

they say: "everything happens for a reason"
you need: "this is shit and I'm sorry"

they say: "just upskill"
you need: "you're allowed to fall apart first"

they say: "at least you got severance"
you need: "your grief is valid regardless"

---

### reel 4: "the real stages" (20 sec)

[dark background. stages appear one by one.]

the real stages of job loss:

1. shock — "wait, what?"
2. fake optimism — "this is my chance!"
3. the crash — "oh. this is real."
4. the 2am spiral — "who am I now?"
5. the unnamed thing — grief for a life that isn't coming back.

nobody talks about stage 5.

[end card]: we do. | link in bio

**caption:** if you skipped straight from stage 1 to stage 4... you're not behind. there is no schedule for grief. save this for the day the fake optimism wears off.

### reel 5: "the 5-4-3-2-1 reset" (20 sec)

[calm dark background. text appears slowly with pauses.]

when the spiral starts, try this:
5 things you can see.
4 things you can touch.
3 things you can hear.
2 things you can smell.
1 thing you can taste.
you're back in the room.
this is yours. use it whenever you need it.

[end card]: save this for 2am. | @luminouspulse.co

**caption:** this is a clinical grounding technique therapists use for panic and dissociation. it works by pulling your nervous system out of threat mode. it's free. it's yours. more practices — link in bio.

---

### reel 6: "still here" (20 sec)

[dark background. one line at a time. slow. let each line land.]

things that are true even when you don't feel them:

you are more than your job title.
your competence didn't leave when your badge did.
the people who love you didn't love your linkedin headline.
you don't need to perform recovery.
damn it — you are still here. that IS the evidence.

[end card]: @luminouspulse.co | save this

**caption:** you don't have to believe all of these right now. save this for the day you might.

| 14 | save-worthy | reshare best-performing post + "send this to someone who needs it" |

## additional hooks for month 2+ content creation

> when you need new content, pick a hook from the library (section 3 above) and write:
> - **quote card**: hook text on the card + 100-150 word caption
> - **carousel**: hook on slide 1 + 6 slides expanding on it + CTA slide
> - **reel**: hook as first line + 5-7 lines building on it + end card

### bonus hooks (month 2):
41. the scariest part isn't the unemployment. it's the way nobody checks on you after week 2.
42. you're not "between opportunities." you're in grief. there's a difference.
43. the linkedin "I'm humbled to announce" post is the biggest lie on the internet.
44. they replaced your whole department and posted about "exciting new directions" the same week.
45. your therapist shouldn't be the only person who knows the truth about how you're doing.
