## Email 1: the story (Day 7)

**Subject**: what I wish someone told me about this feeling

**Preview text**: it wasn't a tool that scared me. it was a meeting.

---

hey,

your 5-day practice ended a couple of days ago. I hope at least one of those grounding words is still with you.

I want to tell you something I haven't shared publicly — the reason I started writing these words in the first place.

last year I was in a meeting where my manager pulled up a demo of a tool that could do — in 45 seconds — something that took me two days to produce.

nobody in the room looked at me. but I felt it.

that night I went home and spiraled. not about the tool. about what I was worth without the thing I thought made me valuable.

and here's what I figured out over the next few weeks: the spiral wasn't about AI. it was about identity. I had tied my worth to my output — and when a machine matched my output, I didn't know who I was without it.

that's the real crisis nobody talks about. it's not a skills gap. it's an identity gap.

the grounding words I write aren't about ignoring what's happening or pretending everything is fine. they're about remembering who you are underneath what you produce. the part of you that loves, that cares, that shows up even when it's hard.

if you've ever felt that unnamed heaviness after reading a headline — you're not broken. you're human. and that's the whole point.

that's why I started building things for this feeling — not just the daily affirmations, but actual workbooks. printable journals for the grief, the identity crisis, the anger, the slow rebuilding. the kind of work that happens with a pen in your hand, not a screen in your face.

I'll tell you more about them soon. for now, I just wanted you to know where this all comes from.

more soon,
Christie

P.S. — I'd love to know: has anything shifted for you since starting the practice? even something small? just reply — I read every one.

---

## Email 2: where are you right now? (Day 10)

**Subject**: which one of these sounds like you right now?

**Preview text**: 5 feelings. 5 different starting points. (plus 3 grounding words.)

---

hey,

before I share what I've been building, I want to check in. because this transition doesn't look the same for everyone. and the thing you need right now depends on where you actually are — not where you think you should be.

so. which one of these sounds like you right now?

**"I'm in crisis mode. I can barely breathe."**
→ you need grounding techniques you can use in the next 5 minutes. not a journal. not a 30-day plan. a lifeline.

**"I have an interview coming up and I'm terrified."**
→ you need something specific for the 30 minutes before the room. nervous system regulation. a way to talk about the gap without your voice cracking.

**"I'm grieving and I don't know what to do with it."**
→ you need a place to put the loss. the anger. the sadness. a grief journal that doesn't pretend this is an opportunity.

**"I don't know who I am anymore."**
→ you need identity work. not a career plan — an excavation of who you are underneath the title that's gone.

**"I want a daily practice. something small, every day."**
→ you need one page. one prompt. one breath. one offline thing. repeated for 30 days until ground forms.

I built something for each of those feelings. a collection of printable workbooks — designed to be written in by hand, because neuroscience shows that handwriting activates emotional processing centers that typing can't reach.

I'll share the details in my next email. for now, here are three grounding words to carry into your week:

**if the future feels heavy:**
> *"I will not panic about a future I am actively building."*

**if imposter syndrome is loud:**
> *"I can learn any tool. no tool can learn to be me."*

**if you need permission to slow down:**
> *"I do not need to optimize my morning. I need to feel it."*

pick one. say it out loud tomorrow morning. two seconds to shift the energy.

more soon,
Christie

P.S. — reply and tell me which feeling matched. I read every response, and it helps me know what to send you next.

## Email 3: the full collection (Day 14)

**Subject**: I built a workbook for every part of this

**Preview text**: grief. identity. interviews. daily practice. 340+ pages of sanctuary.

---

hey,

two weeks ago you started a 5-day grounding practice. I hope those words are still finding you.

today I want to show you what I've been building behind those 5 days. because the free practice was just the door. what's on the other side is a full collection of printable workbooks — each one designed for a specific part of this transition.

**here's the whole collection:**

**"before the room"** — $9
for the 30 minutes before the interview that scares you. a timed grounding ritual, gap story reframes, 3 evidence-based nervous system techniques, and a tear-out reference card that fits in your pocket.
> **[get "before the room" →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

**"tender landings"** — $12
a grief journal for career loss. 6 sections for naming what hurts, moving through the grief cycle, writing the letters you'll never send, and finding what remains. 44 pages for the version of you that's still in the thick of it.
> **[get "tender landings" →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

**"who am I without the title?"** — $15
8 guided exercises for rebuilding identity: roles mapping, values archaeology, "20 things that make me, me," composting the old identity, and a sealed letter to your future self. 49 pages of the work nobody tells you to do.
> **[get "who am I without the title?" →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

**"steady"** — $15
12 weeks of checking in with yourself. Monday intentions, mid-week body check-ins, Friday reflections, weekend analog activities. 63 pages of slow, patient ground.
> **[get "steady" →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

**"30 days of ground"** — $17
one page per day. one prompt. one breath. one offline thing. plus 30 printable affirmation cards. 66 pages for building ground one day at a time.
> **[get "30 days of ground" →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

**"the in-between"** — $27
the flagship. 90 pages across 8 chapters — from the freefall to the first steps. the deepest work. the longest journey. the one people tell me changed how they see this transition.
> **[get "the in-between" →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

**every workbook is designed to be printed and written in by hand.** because your hands need to be part of this conversation.

not sure where to start? here's my suggestion:
- **if you're in the early days →** "tender landings" ($12) or "who am I without the title?" ($15)
- **if you want daily structure →** "30 days of ground" ($17)
- **if you're ready for the deep work →** "the in-between" ($27)

you don't need all of them. you need the one that matches where you are right now.

you are held,
Christie

P.S. — if the budget is tight right now, I get it. the free 5-day practice is yours forever and the grounding words I share are always free. but if you do want to go deeper, "before the room" or "tender landings" are the gentlest entry points — $9 and $12.

## Email 4: social proof + bundles (Day 17)

**Subject**: "the unsent letters broke something open"

**Preview text**: what people keep telling me about the workbooks.

---

hey,

I want to share some things people have been telling me about the workbooks. not testimonials — just the quiet messages that show up in my inbox.

about **"tender landings"** (the grief journal):
> *"the unsent letters section broke something open. I wrote a letter to my old manager and cried for twenty minutes. and then I felt lighter. I don't know how to explain it."*

about **"who am I without the title?"**:
> *"I got stuck on number 8 of the '20 things that make me, me' exercise. and then I realized — I literally couldn't name 20 things about myself that weren't work-related. that was the moment I knew I needed this."*

about **"before the room"**:
> *"I used the cold reset technique before my interview yesterday. splashed cold water on my face in the bathroom. my heart rate actually dropped. I could feel it. walked in calmer than I've been in months."*

about **"the in-between"**:
> *"I'm only on chapter 3 and I've already filled 14 pages. I didn't think I had this much to say. turns out I just didn't have anywhere to put it."*

these aren't affirmation people. they're engineers, PMs, designers, marketers, teachers. people who would never buy a "gratitude journal." but a grief journal that names the exact thing they're carrying? a pre-interview guide with evidence-based techniques? that lands differently.

**two ways to get more for less:**

**the recovery starter** — $27 (save 25%)
emergency grounding kit + "tender landings" + "who am I without the title?" — the essential trio for the early days. 113 pages.
> **[get the recovery starter →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

**the complete grounding collection** — $47 (save 67%)
every single workbook. 404 pages. $141+ value. the whole sanctuary in one file.
> **[get the complete collection →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

or grab just the one that matches where you are:
- crisis mode → Emergency Grounding Kit ($9)
- interview coming → "before the room" ($9)
- grieving → "tender landings" ($12)
- identity crisis → "who am I without the title?" ($15)
- need daily structure → "30 days of ground" ($17)
- ready for the deep work → "the in-between" ($27)

whichever one calls to you — that's the right one.

with you in this,
Christie

P.S. — if you've already grabbed a workbook and something in it hit different, I'd love to hear. just reply. those messages are what keep me building.

## Email 5: the one email with everything (Day 21)

**Subject**: everything I've made, in one place

**Preview text**: the full collection. one last time.

---

hey,

this is the last time I'll lay out the full collection for a while. after this, we go back to grounding words, honest stories, and the occasional reminder that you're not alone in this.

so here's everything, in case you've been thinking about it:

**individual workbooks:**
- "before the room" — $9 (28 pages, interview grounding)
- "tender landings" — $12 (44 pages, career grief journal)
- "who am I without the title?" — $15 (49 pages, identity reclamation)
- "steady" — $15 (63 pages, 12-week reflection practice)
- "30 days of ground" — $17 (66 pages, daily practice)
- "the in-between" — $27 (90 pages, the flagship)
- The 30-Day Luminous Pulse Practice — $37 (the original)

**bundles:**
- **the recovery starter** — **$27** (3 workbooks, 113 pages, $36 value)
  emergency grounding kit + "tender landings" + "who am I without the title?"
  > **[get the recovery starter →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

- **the complete grounding collection** — **$47** (8 workbooks, 404 pages, $141+ value)
  every single product. 67% off. the whole sanctuary.
  > **[get the complete collection →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

**my honest recommendation:**

if you're early in this transition and budget is tight — grab "tender landings" for $12. it's the most emotionally raw thing I've made, and the unsent letters section alone is worth it.

if you want the best value and you're in this for the long haul — the complete collection at $47 gives you everything. print sections as you need them. you'll have the right workbook for wherever you are, whenever you need it.

if none of this is right for you right now — that's genuinely okay. the free 5-day practice is yours forever. I'll keep writing grounding words in your inbox every week. this collection isn't going anywhere.

after this email, I won't pitch for a while. we'll go back to our regular rhythm: words for hard days, permission to feel all of it, and the occasional story about what it's like to be human right now.

you are held. don't forget it.

Christie

P.S. — your humanity is not the problem. it is the answer. everything I build starts from that belief.

## Metrics to Track

- **Email 1 (Story)**: Open rate target 35%+, reply rate ("has anything shifted?")
- **Email 2 (Feeling match)**: Open rate target 30%+, reply rate ("which feeling matched?"), click rate on any product link
- **Email 3 (Collection reveal)**: Open rate target 30%+, click rate on individual workbook links, conversion rate target 3-5% on any product
- **Email 4 (Proof + bundles)**: Open rate target 28%+, click rate on bundle links, bundle vs individual conversion split
- **Email 5 (Full catalog)**: Open rate target 35%+, click rate on collection link, conversion rate target 5-8%

## Expected Conversion

**with expanded product range ($9-$47):**
- 5-8% of nurture subscribers convert to any paid product (up from 3-5% with single $37 offer)
- lower price points ($9-$15) reduce friction → higher conversion rate on first purchase
- tripwire buyers convert at 10-15% (already paid once, warmer leads, now more options)
- average order value estimate: $18-25 (mix of individual workbooks and bundles)
- at $20 avg, every 100 subscribers = $100-160 revenue from nurture sequence alone
- bundle buyers ($27-$47) represent highest LTV — already committed to the ecosystem

**conversion funnel targets:**
| product tier | conversion from nurture | avg revenue per converter |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| $9-$12 workbooks | 3-4% | $10.50 |
| $15-$17 workbooks | 1-2% | $16 |
| $27 flagship or starter bundle | 1-2% | $27 |
| $47 complete collection | 0.5-1% | $47 |
| **blended** | **5-8%** | **$18-25** |
