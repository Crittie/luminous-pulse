# quiz outcome email sequences — 4 personalized paths

> **context**: these 4 email sequences replace the generic nurture sequence for quiz takers. when someone completes "find your grounding practice" (the self-assessment), they're tagged with one of 4 outcomes and enter the matching sequence below.
>
> **trigger**: quiz completion via Interact → Kit tag applied → sequence begins
> **tone**: same as all luminous pulse copy — lowercase, warm, tender, 2am-appropriate. like writing to one person who can't sleep.
> **from name**: Christie at Luminous Pulse
> **timing**: day 0, day 3, day 7, day 12, day 17 (from quiz completion)
>
> **important differences from generic nurture**:
> - we already know what sam is carrying (the quiz told us) — no need for the "which one sounds like you?" diagnostic email
> - we can name their specific feeling from email 1 — builds instant trust
> - the prescription is sharper — one primary product recommendation, not a catalog browse
> - the origin story is woven into email 2 (not email 1) — tailored to match their outcome
> - everyone still gets the free 5-day grounding practice PDF in email 1
>
> **product mapping**:
> | outcome | Kit tag | primary product | secondary | upsell |
> |---------|---------|----------------|-----------|--------|
> | the tender one | `quiz-tender` | tender landings ($12) | who am I without the title? ($15) | recovery starter bundle ($27) |
> | the unnamed one | `quiz-identity` | who am I without the title? ($15) | tender landings ($12) | recovery starter bundle ($27) |
> | the bracing one | `quiz-grounding` | before the room ($9) | 30 days of ground ($17) | complete collection ($47) |

# sequence 1: "the tender one"

> **tag**: `quiz-tender`
> **who they are**: sam is in the raw part. the grief is still fresh — weeks or a couple months in. they selected things like "I'm grieving and I don't know what to do with it" and "the thing I carry but don't talk about" resonated deeply. they're not looking for structure or identity work yet. they need a place to put the loss.

## email 1: your results (Day 0)

**Subject**: your grounding practice results are here

**Preview text**: I made you something based on what you shared.

---

hey,

you just finished the self-assessment. I want you to know — there are no wrong answers, and nothing you shared is something I haven't heard before. the feelings you named? they're more common than anyone admits out loud.

**here's what your answers tell me:**

you're in the tender part. the grief is still close — maybe closer than you expected it to be. the loss isn't just a job. it's routine, identity, belonging. and nobody around you is treating it like grief because it doesn't look like grief is "supposed to" look.

but it is grief. and you're not dramatic for feeling it.

**your grounding practice starts here:**

I put together a free 5-day grounding practice — one affirmation, one breathwork exercise, and one reflection prompt per day. it takes 2 minutes. it's yours to print or keep on your phone.

> **[download the free 5-day grounding practice →]** *(link to Kit form/download)*

start tonight if you can. Day 1's affirmation:

> *"I give myself permission to not know everything and still be enough."*

say it out loud. even if it feels strange. especially if it feels strange.

I'll be in your inbox again in a few days with something written specifically for what you're carrying.

you are held,
Christie

## email 2: the naming (Day 3)

**Subject**: nobody calls it grief when it's a job

**Preview text**: but that's what it is.

---

hey,

I want to tell you something I've been thinking about since you took the self-assessment.

nobody calls it grief when it's a job.

when someone dies, there are rituals. flowers. casseroles. people check on you. when someone loses a job — especially in a mass layoff, especially when hundreds of people got the same email — the expectation is: dust yourself off. update LinkedIn. move on.

but grief doesn't care about the source. it cares about the attachment.

and if you gave years of your life to something — your time, your creativity, your identity — and then it disappeared in a single email? that's a real loss. the empty calendar is a real loss. the silence where Slack used to be is a real loss. the way you still reach for your laptop at 8am is a real loss.

I know because I've been in that room. I watched someone demo a tool that could do my job in 45 seconds. nobody looked at me. but I felt it. and that night, the spiral wasn't about the tool. it was about who I was without the thing I thought made me valuable.

that's when I started writing grounding words. not to fix the feeling. to name it.

naming is the first act of healing. neuroscience shows that putting language to an emotion reduces amygdala activation by up to 50%. you don't need to solve the grief. you need to say it out loud first.

here's one for tonight:

> *"I am allowed to grieve this. even if nobody sends flowers for it."*

more in a few days.

Christie

## email 3: the prescription (Day 7)

**Subject**: I made something for exactly where you are

**Preview text**: 44 pages for naming what nobody talks about.

---

hey,

it's been a week since you took the self-assessment. I hope the grounding practice has given you at least a few breaths of space.

I want to show you something I built specifically for the feeling you described.

**"tender landings" — a grief journal for career loss. $12.**

it's 44 pages. not inspirational. not "everything happens for a reason." just honest.

**what's inside:**

- **naming the loss** — prompts for identifying what you actually lost (hint: it wasn't just the paycheck)
- **the grief cycle** — a check-in for all 5 stages, because you might be angry and bargaining and accepting all in the same afternoon
- **anger is welcome here** — a dedicated section for the fury that has nowhere to go
- **letters you'll never send** — 3 unsent letters: to the person who delivered the news, to the company, and to yourself. this is the section people tell me broke something open.
- **what remains** — for finding what's still true about you after the title is gone

it's designed to be printed and written in by hand. because your hands need to be part of this conversation.

> **[get "tender landings" — $12 →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

I priced it low on purpose. I know what it feels like to be financially stressed and emotionally wrecked at the same time. $12 shouldn't be the barrier between you and a place to put all of this.

if the budget is tight right now, that's genuinely okay. the free practice is yours forever. but if you're ready to go deeper into the grief — this is where I'd start.

with you in this,
Christie

P.S. — the unsent letters section is the one that surprises people. you don't have to send them. you just have to write them. the relief is in the writing.

---

## email 4: the proof (Day 12)

**Subject**: "I wrote a letter to my old manager and cried for twenty minutes"

**Preview text**: and then I felt lighter. I don't know how to explain it.

---

hey,

I want to share something that showed up in my inbox recently about "tender landings":

> *"the unsent letters section broke something open. I wrote a letter to my old manager and cried for twenty minutes. and then I felt lighter. I don't know how to explain it."*

and this:

> *"I got to the grief cycle check-in and checked all five stages. I didn't know you could feel all of them at once. seeing that written down — that it's normal — was the first time I didn't feel broken in weeks."*

and this:

> *"I don't cry about the job. I cry about the team. the morning standups. the inside jokes. nobody tells you that's the part that guts you."*

these aren't affirmation people. they're PMs, engineers, designers, marketers. people who would never buy a "gratitude journal." but a grief journal that names the exact thing they're carrying? that lands differently.

if "tender landings" spoke to you but you want to go deeper, there's a natural next step:

**"who am I without the title?"** — $15. 8 guided exercises for rebuilding identity underneath the grief. because once you've named the loss, the next question is: who am I now?

> **[get "who am I without the title?" — $15 →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

or if you want both (plus the emergency grounding kit):

**the recovery starter** — $27 (save 25%). the essential trio for the early days: emergency grounding + grief journal + identity work. 113 pages.

> **[get the recovery starter — $27 →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

whichever one calls to you — that's the right one. and if none of them do right now, that's okay too.

Christie

## email 5: the quiet close (Day 17)

**Subject**: the last thing, and then we go back to grounding words

**Preview text**: no pitch after this. just words for hard days.

---

hey,

this is the last time I'll bring up the workbooks for a while. after this, we go back to our regular rhythm: grounding words, honest stories, and the occasional reminder that you're not alone in this.

so here's everything, one last time:

**where you are → what I'd recommend:**

- the grief is still raw → **"tender landings"** ($12) — [link]
- you're starting to ask "who am I now?" → **"who am I without the title?"** ($15) — [link]
- you want both + the emergency kit → **the recovery starter** ($27, save 25%) — [link]
- you want everything for the whole journey → **the complete collection** ($47, save 67%) — [link]

**my honest recommendation for you:**

based on what you shared in the assessment — start with "tender landings." $12. the unsent letters section alone is worth it. if the grief opens into an identity question later, the identity workbook will be here.

if none of this is right for you right now — the free 5-day practice is yours forever. I'll keep writing grounding words. this collection isn't going anywhere.

after this email, no more pitching. just words for the days that need them.

you are held. don't forget it.

Christie

P.S. — if something in the grounding practice shifted something for you — even something small — I'd love to hear. just reply. those messages are what keep me writing.

---

# sequence 2: "the unnamed one"

> **tag**: `quiz-identity`
> **who they are**: sam is past the acute grief. the shock has faded. what's left is the identity crisis — they don't know who they are without the title, the team, the role. they selected things like "I don't know who I am without that role" and "the hardest question won't be 'what's next?' — it'll be 'who am I now?'"
> **primary product**: who am I without the title? ($15)

---

## email 1: your results (Day 0)

**Subject**: your grounding practice results are here

**Preview text**: the question nobody asks but you can't stop asking yourself.

---

hey,

you just finished the self-assessment. and I want to name something out loud that your answers pointed to — because I think it's the thing you've been carrying but haven't had words for.

**the crisis isn't the job loss. it's the identity loss.**

the layoff happened. and then underneath it, something quieter happened: you realized you don't know who you are without the title. the team. the role. the thing you introduced yourself as at every dinner party for years.

and nobody around you is asking that question. they're asking "what's next?" and "have you applied anywhere?" but the real question — the one that keeps you up at 2am — is: *who am I now?*

you're not broken for asking that. you're honest.

**your grounding practice starts here:**

I put together a free 5-day grounding practice — one affirmation, one breathwork exercise, and one reflection prompt per day. 2 minutes. printable or on your phone.

> **[download the free 5-day grounding practice →]** *(link to Kit form/download)*

start tonight with this one:

> *"I am whole before I open my laptop. I always was."*

say it out loud. let it land. and if it makes you feel something — that's not weakness. that's the beginning.

more soon,
Christie

---

## email 2: the naming (Day 3)

**Subject**: the identity gap nobody talks about

**Preview text**: it was never a skills gap. it was this.

---

hey,

I've been thinking about something since you took the self-assessment.

everyone calls it a "skills gap" or a "career transition." but what you're actually going through? that's an identity gap. and nobody has a playbook for it.

I know because I lived it. last year I watched someone demo a tool that could do my job in 45 seconds. and that night the spiral wasn't about the tool. it was about this: if a machine can do the thing I thought made me valuable — then who am I?

I had tied my entire identity to my output. my worth was measured in what I produced. and when the production wasn't unique anymore, I didn't know what was left.

here's what I eventually figured out: everything was left. the judgment. the instinct. the way I read a room. the relationships I'd built. the stubborn refusal to give up on hard projects. none of that was in my output. all of it was in me.

but I couldn't see it until I did the identity work. not career planning. not resume updates. the actual excavation of who I am underneath what I do.

that's what I started building. and that's what I'll share with you soon.

for tonight:

> *"I am more than what I produce. the world just hasn't caught up to what I know."*

Christie

---

## email 3: the prescription (Day 7)

**Subject**: I built this for the question you can't stop asking

**Preview text**: 49 pages of the work nobody tells you to do.

---

hey,

one week in. I hope the grounding practice has started to settle something — even something small.

now I want to show you the thing I built for the question your answers pointed to.

**"who am I without the title?" — 8 exercises for reclaiming who you are. $15.**

49 pages. not career planning. identity work.

**what's inside:**

1. **the roles inventory** — mapping every role you play beyond your job title. you are more than you remember.
2. **values archaeology** — digging beneath the career to find the values that were always there. the job was the vehicle, not the destination.
3. **"20 things that make me, me"** — the simplest and hardest exercise. 20 truths about yourself that have nothing to do with work. most people get stuck around number 8. that's where the real work begins.
4. **the origin story** — tracing the thread from who you were before the career.
5. **composting the old identity** — a ritual for letting go of the title without pretending it didn't matter.
6. **seeds of who I'm becoming** — not a plan. not a pivot. just seeds.
7. **the permission slip** — a signed declaration that you are allowed to not know yet.
8. **letter to your future self** — sealed, dated, to be opened in 90 days. the person who writes this letter and the person who opens it will not be the same.

designed to be printed and written in by hand. because neuroscience shows that handwriting activates emotional processing centers that typing can't reach. and when you're rebuilding identity, your hands need to be part of the conversation.

> **[start the identity work — $15 →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

this is not the only workbook I've made. but based on what you shared — this is where I'd start.

with you in this,
Christie

P.S. — Exercise 5 — composting the old identity — is the one people tell me changed something. it's a ritual for putting down the title with honesty, not denial. "it mattered. and I can still let it go." if you do nothing else, do that one.

---

## email 4: the proof (Day 12)

**Subject**: "I couldn't name 20 things about myself that weren't work-related"

**Preview text**: that was the moment I knew I needed this.

---

hey,

I want to share something that landed in my inbox about "who am I without the title?":

> *"I got stuck on number 8 of the '20 things that make me, me' exercise. and then I realized — I literally couldn't name 20 things about myself that weren't work-related. that was the moment I knew I needed this."*

and this:

> *"the composting exercise broke me in the best way. I'd been pretending the old job didn't matter so I could 'move on.' writing down what it actually meant to me — and then choosing to put it down — was completely different from pretending."*

and this:

> *"I sealed the letter to my future self and put it in my nightstand drawer. 90 days. I'm terrified and curious. the person who opens it won't be the person who wrote it. I already know that."*

these are engineers, PMs, designers. analytical people. the kind who roll their eyes at "self-help." but this isn't self-help. it's self-examination. and when someone hands you a structured framework for the question you can't stop asking — that's different.

if you've started the identity work and the grief is still there underneath, there's a natural companion:

**"tender landings"** — $12. 44 pages for naming the loss, writing the letters you'll never send, and finding what remains. the grief journal that goes alongside the identity work.

> **[get "tender landings" — $12 →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

or both together (plus the emergency kit):

**the recovery starter** — $27 (save 25%). grief + identity + emergency grounding. 113 pages.

> **[get the recovery starter — $27 →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

## email 5: the quiet close (Day 17)

**Subject**: the last thing, and then we go back to grounding words

**Preview text**: no pitch after this. just the regular rhythm.

---

hey,

last time I'll lay out the workbooks for a while. after this — grounding words, honest stories, and the occasional reminder that you're not alone in this.

**where you are → what I'd recommend:**

- the identity question won't stop → **"who am I without the title?"** ($15) — [link]
- the grief is still underneath → **"tender landings"** ($12) — [link]
- you want both + emergency kit → **the recovery starter** ($27, save 25%) — [link]
- you want everything for the whole journey → **the complete collection** ($47, save 67%) — [link]

**my honest recommendation for you:**

start with "who am I without the title?" Exercise 3 — "20 things that make me, me" — is the one that cracks it open. $15. if the identity work surfaces grief (it often does), the grief journal will be here.

if none of this is right for you right now — the free practice is yours forever. this collection isn't going anywhere. and neither am I.

you are held,
Christie

P.S. — one more grounding word for the road:

> *"I am becoming someone I haven't met yet. and I am already enough to begin."*

---

# sequence 3: "the bracing one"

> **tag**: `quiz-grounding`
> **who they are**: sam needs something immediate. they're in the thick of active anxiety — interviews coming up, phone calls they're dreading, spirals at 2am. they selected things like "something to calm my body when the spiral starts" and "I'm terrified of what comes next." they don't want to journal about feelings yet. they need tools they can use in the next 5 minutes.
> **primary product**: before the room ($9)
> **secondary product**: 30 days of ground ($17)

---

## email 1: your results (Day 0)

**Subject**: your grounding practice results are here

**Preview text**: something for the next time your hands start shaking.

---

hey,

you just finished the self-assessment. and what your answers tell me is: you don't need a journal right now. you need a toolkit.

something you can use in the next 5 minutes. when the spiral starts. when the interview is in 30 minutes. when you're lying awake and your brain won't stop running scenarios.

your body is in survival mode. that's not a flaw — that's your nervous system doing exactly what it was designed to do. the problem is that it doesn't know how to turn off.

so before anything else, here's one technique you can use right now:

**the physiological sigh** (backed by Stanford research):
- 2 quick inhales through your nose
- 1 long, slow exhale through your mouth
- repeat 3 times

that's it. your heart rate will drop within 30 seconds. your body doesn't need motivation. it needs a signal that you're safe.

**your grounding practice starts here:**

I put together a free 5-day grounding practice — one affirmation, one breathwork exercise, and one reflection prompt per day. 2 minutes. designed for the version of you that needs something small and immediate.

> **[download the free 5-day grounding practice →]** *(link to Kit form/download)*

try it tonight with this:

> *"I don't have to solve my life tonight. I just have to get through tonight."*

more soon — including a tool built specifically for the 30 minutes before the thing that scares you.

Christie

---

## email 2: the toolkit (Day 3)

**Subject**: 3 techniques for when your body won't calm down

**Preview text**: evidence-based. 5 minutes or less. no journaling required.

---

hey,

I want to give you three things you can use today. no journaling. no reflection prompts. just nervous system tools.

**1. the cold reset (from DBT — dialectical behavior therapy)**

run cold water over your wrists for 10 seconds. or splash cold water on your face. this activates the dive reflex — your body's built-in emergency brake. heart rate drops. breathing slows. it works in under 30 seconds.

use this before an interview. before a hard phone call. before opening the email you've been avoiding.

**2. the 5-4-3-2-1 ground (from CBT)**

name 5 things you can see. 4 things you can touch. 3 you can hear. 2 you can smell. 1 you can taste.

this pulls your brain out of the future (where the spiral lives) and back into the room. use this at 2am when your brain won't stop.

**3. the butterfly hug (from EMDR therapy)**

cross your arms over your chest. tap your left shoulder with your right hand, then your right shoulder with your left hand. alternate, slowly, for 60 seconds.

bilateral stimulation calms the amygdala. it's the same technique trauma therapists use. it works sitting on your couch at midnight.

these aren't theories. they're techniques with clinical evidence. your nervous system responds to physical signals faster than words.

I made all of this into something you can carry with you. more on that in a few days.

Christie

P.S. — if you try one of these tonight, I'd love to know which one worked. just reply. it helps me know what to share next.

---

## email 3: the prescription (Day 7)

**Subject**: for the 30 minutes before the room

**Preview text**: a grounding guide that fits in your pocket. $9.

---

hey,

last email I gave you 3 techniques. here's the thing I built to put them all together — in the right order, at the right time, when you actually need them.

**"before the room" — a grounding guide for interviews, hard conversations, and the moments that scare you. $9.**

28 pages. built for the 30 minutes before.

**what's inside:**

- **a timed 30-minute ritual** — minute by minute, from T-30 to T-5. so you walk in steady instead of spiraling.
- **gap story reframes** — templates for talking about your career gap without apologizing for it.
- **the 3 techniques** — physiological sigh, butterfly hug, cold reset — with step-by-step instructions for each.
- **a post-interview decompression** — because what happens after the room matters too.
- **a tear-out quick reference card** — all techniques on one page. fits in your pocket or bag.

this is not interview prep. this is nervous system prep.

> **[get "before the room" — $9 →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

$9. print it tonight. fold the reference card into whatever bag you carry. the next time your hands start shaking — you'll have something to hold onto.

Christie

P.S. — the cold reset is the one that surprises people most. splashing cold water on your face in a bathroom stall 5 minutes before an interview sounds ridiculous. and then your heart rate drops and you walk in calm. the body doesn't care if it looks silly. it responds to the signal.

---

## email 4: the proof + next step (Day 12)

**Subject**: "my heart rate actually dropped. I could feel it."

**Preview text**: what happens when you give your body what it actually needs.

---

hey,

here's what people have been telling me about "before the room":

> *"I used the cold reset before my interview yesterday. splashed cold water on my face in the bathroom. my heart rate actually dropped. I could feel it. walked in calmer than I've been in months."*

and this:

> *"the gap story reframe changed everything. I stopped apologizing for the gap and started talking about what I learned during it. the interviewer's whole energy shifted."*

and this:

> *"I keep the reference card in my bag now. not just for interviews. I used the physiological sigh before a phone call with my mom last week. works every time."*

the toolkit works in the acute moments. but if you're ready for something that builds ground over time — not just managing the spikes, but building a baseline of calm — there's a daily practice for that:

**"30 days of ground"** — $17. one page per day. one prompt. one breathwork exercise. one offline thing. one affirmation. plus 30 printable affirmation cards.

> **[start the 30 days — $17 →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

think of "before the room" as the emergency brake. "30 days of ground" is the practice that makes the emergencies less frequent.

or if you want everything — the toolkit, the daily practice, the grief journal, the identity work, all of it:

**the complete collection** — $47 (save 67%). 8 workbooks, 404 pages.

> **[get the complete collection — $47 →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

Christie

---

## email 5: the quiet close (Day 17)

**Subject**: one last thing, then back to grounding words

**Preview text**: the toolkit. the daily practice. and then just us.

---

hey,

last time I'll bring up the workbooks for a while. after this — techniques, grounding words, and the occasional reminder that your nervous system is doing its best.

**where you are → what I'd recommend:**

- you need something for the next hard moment → **"before the room"** ($9) — [link]
- you want to build daily ground → **"30 days of ground"** ($17) — [link]
- grief or identity stuff is surfacing underneath the anxiety → **the recovery starter** ($27) — [link]
- you want everything → **the complete collection** ($47, save 67%) — [link]

**my honest recommendation for you:**

start with "before the room" at $9. it's the most immediately useful thing I've made. print the reference card. put it in your bag. use it before the next hard thing. if that builds trust, "30 days of ground" is the daily practice that makes the baseline steadier.

if nothing here is right for you right now — the free practice and the 3 techniques from email 2 are yours forever.

after this email, we go back to regular grounding: techniques, breathwork, and words for the days that knock you sideways.

you are held,
Christie

P.S. — one more for the road. for tonight:

> *"my body is not betraying me. it is protecting me. and I can teach it that I am safe."*

## email 1: your results (Day 0)

**Subject**: your grounding practice results are here

**Preview text**: you've been in this for a while. here's what I'd start with.

---

hey,

you just finished the self-assessment. and what your answers tell me is something most people don't get to — you've moved past the initial shock. the acute grief. the emergency phase.

but here's the thing nobody tells you about the long middle: it's harder in some ways than the beginning. in the beginning, there's adrenaline. urgency. something to react to. in the middle, there's just... you. and the question of what comes next. and the slow, heavy work of rebuilding something steady out of uncertainty.

you're not behind for being here. you're doing the hardest part.

**your grounding practice starts here:**

I put together a free 5-day grounding practice — one affirmation, one breathwork exercise, one reflection prompt per day. 2 minutes. a good re-entry point even if you've been doing some inner work already.

> **[download the free 5-day grounding practice →]** *(link to Kit form/download)*

start tonight with this:

> *"I have adapted before. I will adapt again. my resilience is not a theory — it's my lived history."*

you've survived every hard day you've ever had. your track record is 100%. the pattern says you'll handle this one too.

more soon,
Christie

---

## email 2: the long middle (Day 3)

**Subject**: the part nobody prepared you for

**Preview text**: the emergency fades. what's left is this.

---

hey,

can I be honest about something?

I think the hardest part of this whole thing isn't the layoff. it's what happens 3 months later when everyone thinks you're over it.

the shock fades. the grief softens. the anger finds somewhere to live. and then you're just... here. in the after. with a quieter kind of heavy that doesn't have a name or a timeline.

your friends stopped checking in. LinkedIn moved on. and you're sitting in a coffee shop on a Tuesday afternoon wondering: how do I build something steady when the ground keeps shifting?

I know this version of the transition because I lived through my own version. last year I watched a tool do my job in 45 seconds. the initial spiral was loud. but the months that followed were quieter and harder — the slow, grinding work of figuring out who I was now and what mattered to me outside of what I produced.

what I eventually found: I didn't need another dramatic breakthrough. I needed a rhythm. something small I could do every week that reminded me I was still here, still showing up, still building.

that's what I started building for people in this exact phase. not crisis tools. not grief journals. a weekly practice for the long middle.

more on that in a few days.

## email 3: the prescription (Day 7)

**Subject**: 12 weeks of checking in with yourself

**Preview text**: not goals. not KPIs. just steady ground.

---

hey,

a week in. if the 5-day practice gave you even a few moments of quiet — that's the seed.

here's the thing I built for where you are.

**"steady" — 12 weeks of checking in with yourself. $15.**

63 pages. no goals. no productivity hacks. no "by week 12 you will have..." promises. just a weekly rhythm that belongs to you.

**what's inside:**

**12 weekly spreads, each with 4 pages:**
- **Monday intention** — one question to set the tone
- **mid-week check-in** — a body scan + honest reflection on where you actually are (not where you think you should be)
- **Friday reflection** — looking back at the week with a one-word summary
- **weekend analog activity** — one offline thing to do with your hands, feet, or senses

**3 monthly themes:**
- month 1: **grounding** — finding your feet. what's still true.
- month 2: **reconnecting** — reaching toward the people and parts of yourself you've been avoiding.
- month 3: **building** — planting something. not a plan. just a seed.

**3 monthly reviews:**
- what shifted this month?
- what do I want to carry forward?
- what am I ready to release?

it's designed to be printed and written in by hand. start on any Monday. one page at a time.

> **[start the 12 weeks — $15 →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

based on what you shared in the assessment — this is the workbook I'd hand you. not the crisis tools. not the grief journal. the slow, patient practice for the person who's past the emergency and ready for the rebuild.

with you in this,
Christie

P.S. — the analog activities are the part that surprises people. "walk barefoot in grass for 2 minutes." "rearrange one shelf." "cook something without a recipe." small acts of presence. they sound simple. they're weirdly powerful.

## email 4: the proof + next step (Day 12)

**Subject**: "I didn't think I needed structure. I was wrong."

**Preview text**: what 12 weeks of checking in does.

---

hey,

here's what people have told me about "steady":

> *"I didn't think I needed structure. I've been journaling on and off for months. but having the Monday/Wednesday/Friday rhythm changed everything. I actually look forward to the mid-week check-in now."*

and this:

> *"the monthly review at the end of month 1 — 'what am I ready to release?' — I wrote down my old job title. and then I cried. and then I realized I hadn't said it out loud in weeks. that's the shift."*

and this:

> *"the weekend analog activities are my favorite part. I baked bread last Saturday. I haven't baked in years. I forgot I loved it."*

"steady" is for the slow work. but if you also want a daily practice — something more granular, one page per day — there's this:

**"30 days of ground"** — $17. one prompt, one breathwork exercise, one offline thing, one affirmation. every day for 30 days. plus 30 printable affirmation cards.

> **[start the 30 days — $17 →]** *(link to Kit Commerce product)*

some people do "30 days of ground" first (to build the daily habit) and then transition to "steady" (for the weekly rhythm). others start with "steady" and add the daily practice when they want more depth. either way works.

or if you want everything — all the tools for every phase of this transition:

**the complete collection** — $47 (save 67%). 8 workbooks, 404 pages. grief, identity, interviews, daily practice, weekly reflections, and the flagship. the whole sanctuary.

## email 5: the quiet close (Day 17)

**Subject**: one last thing, and then just us

**Preview text**: the full collection. one last time. then grounding words forever.

---

hey,

last time I'll lay it all out for a while. after this — grounding words, honest stories, and the slow, patient rhythm of showing up.

**where you are → what I'd recommend:**

- you need a weekly rhythm → **"steady"** ($15) — [link]
- you want a daily practice → **"30 days of ground"** ($17) — [link]
- grief or identity work is calling → **the recovery starter** ($27) — [link]
- you want everything for the whole journey → **the complete collection** ($47, save 67%) — [link]

**my honest recommendation for you:**

you're in the rebuild phase. that's rare and important — most people are still in the emergency. "steady" at $15 is built for exactly where you are: 12 weeks of slow ground. if you want the full toolkit for wherever this goes next, the complete collection at $47 is the best value and gives you the right workbook for whatever surfaces.

if none of this is right for you right now — the free practice is yours forever. and I'll keep showing up in your inbox with words for the days that need them.

you are held. you've been held this whole time.

Christie

P.S. — one last grounding word for you:

> *"the future belongs to people who know who they are. I am becoming that person."*

# sequence settings

## tags and triggers

| outcome | Kit tag | trigger |
|---------|---------|---------|
| the tender one | `quiz-tender` | Interact quiz result → Kit tag via native integration |
| the unnamed one | `quiz-identity` | Interact quiz result → Kit tag via native integration |
| the bracing one | `quiz-grounding` | Interact quiz result → Kit tag via native integration |
| the rebuilder | `quiz-rebuild` | Interact quiz result → Kit tag via native integration |

## timing (all 4 sequences)

| email | timing | purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | day 0 (immediate) | quiz results + free practice PDF |
| 2 | day 3 | deeper content + origin story tailored to outcome |
| 3 | day 7 | prescription — primary product recommendation |
| 4 | day 12 | social proof + secondary product / upsell |
| 5 | day 17 | soft close + full collection option |

## tags applied during sequence

| action | tag |
|--------|-----|
| clicks any product link | `interested-workbooks` |
| clicks bundle/collection link | `interested-bundle` |
| purchases any workbook | `workbook-buyer` |
| purchases bundle/collection | `bundle-buyer` → auto-add `paid-customer` |
| completes sequence | `quiz-nurture-complete` |

## exit conditions

```
WHEN tag paid-customer is added at any point
THEN remove from quiz outcome sequence immediately

WHEN tag bundle-buyer is added
THEN add tag paid-customer
THEN remove from sequence

WHEN tag workbook-buyer is added
THEN keep in sequence (workbook buyers may upgrade to bundle)
```

## how this replaces the generic nurture

```
quiz takers:
  Subscribe → quiz results email (Day 0 of outcome sequence)
           → free 5-day practice PDF (attached or linked in email 1)
           → outcome-specific sequence (5 emails over 17 days)
           → quiz-nurture-complete tag
           → weekly newsletter

non-quiz subscribers (keep existing flow):
  Subscribe → incentive email (Day 0)
           → thank-you page tripwire
           → welcome sequence (Day 2, Day 5)
           → generic nurture sequence (Day 7-21)
           → nurture-sequence-complete tag
           → weekly newsletter
```

quiz takers skip the welcome sequence and generic nurture entirely. their email 1 (day 0) serves as both results delivery and welcome. their email 2 (day 3) serves as the value/trust builder. their email 3 (day 7) is the prescription — sharper than the generic "which one sounds like you?" because we already know.

## metrics to track

| metric | target | if below target |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| email 1 open rate | 55%+ | improve subject line (quiz results = high curiosity) |
| email 3 click rate (prescription) | 15%+ | adjust product description or add workbook page preview |
| email 3 → purchase (within 7 days) | 8-12% | revise prescription copy, add urgency or social proof |
| email 4 → upsell click rate | 10%+ | improve social proof or adjust secondary product |
| full sequence → any purchase | 15-20% | review question-to-outcome mapping in quiz |
| outcome distribution (should be roughly even) | 20-30% per outcome | if one outcome gets 50%+, quiz questions aren't differentiating |

## expected conversion (quiz sequences vs generic nurture)

| metric | generic nurture | quiz outcome sequences | improvement |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| email open rates | 30-35% | 40-55% | +40% (personalized subject lines) |
| product click rate | 5-8% | 12-18% | +150% (one product, not catalog) |
| sequence → purchase | 5-8% | 12-18% | +150% (prescription model + segmentation) |
| average order value | $18-22 | $15-20 (first purchase) | slightly lower initial AOV but higher LTV |
| repeat purchase rate | 30% | 40-50% | +40% (trusted from quiz experience) |
