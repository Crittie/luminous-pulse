## the landing page (before the quiz starts)

### headline

find your grounding practice

### subheadline

a 2-minute self-assessment to find the right starting point for where you are right now.

### body copy (below the fold, optional — Interact allows this)

you don't need to read every workbook description and figure out which one fits.

you answer 6 questions. we tell you exactly where to start — based on where you actually are, not where you think you should be.

no judgment. no scoring. no right or wrong answers. just a quiet inventory of what you're carrying right now.

takes about 2 minutes. completely private.

### button CTA

**start the self-assessment**

### trust signals (small text below button)

- 6 questions · 2 minutes · completely private
- no account needed · no app · just honest answers
- your results include a free grounding practice you can start tonight

---

## the email gate (after quiz completion, before results)

> this appears after sam answers all 6 questions. Interact shows a partial result preview, then gates the full result + free practice behind an email.

### headline

your results are ready.

### body

we'll send your full grounding profile + a free 5-day grounding practice (printable PDF — no app, no account, just you and a pen).

### email field label

your email

### button CTA

**see my results**

### privacy note (small text)

we'll never share your email. you can unsubscribe anytime. we send grounding words, not spam.

## result page — outcome 1: "the tender one"

> tag: `quiz-tender` → maps to "tender landings" ($12)

### result headline

you're the tender one.

### result body

you're in the raw part. the grief is still fresh — and nobody around you seems to understand the weight of it.

that's not weakness. that's honesty. most people spend months pretending this doesn't hurt. you're already further along than you think, because you're willing to look at it.

### what this means for your practice

your starting point isn't motivation or strategy. it's **naming**. the grief has a shape, and until you name it, it sits in your chest unnamed and impossible to carry.

### your recommended starting point

**"tender landings"** — 44 pages for naming what nobody talks about.

unsent letters to the role that's gone. grief timelines. permission slips. a space to feel what you're actually feeling — on paper, in private, at your own pace.

## result page — outcome 2: "the unnamed one"

> tag: `quiz-identity` → maps to "who am I without the title?" ($15)

### result headline

you're the unnamed one.

### result body

the job is gone, but the identity crisis stayed. you keep asking yourself who you are without the role — and nobody around you knows that's the real question.

everyone keeps asking "what's next?" but the actual question, the one that wakes you up at 2am, is "who am I now?"

### what this means for your practice

your starting point isn't career planning. it's **excavation**. figuring out who you are underneath the title that's gone — before you try to build a new one on top of the same cracks.

### your recommended starting point

**"who am I without the title?"** — 49 pages of identity work.

8 guided exercises: the 20 things exercise, the identity archaeology dig, the values sort, the "who knew you before the title?" inventory. not career planning. identity work.

## result page — outcome 3: "the bracing one"

> tag: `quiz-grounding` → maps to "before the room" ($9)

### result headline

you're the bracing one.

### result body

you need something immediate. a way to lower the temperature when the spiral starts — before the interview, the phone call, the moment you have to perform being okay.

you're not looking for deep reflection right now. you're looking for a tool that works in 2 minutes flat.

### what this means for your practice

your starting point isn't journaling or naming. it's **regulation**. calming the nervous system first, so everything else becomes possible.

### your recommended starting point

**"before the room"** — a timed grounding ritual for the moment everything feels like too much.

the 60-second cold reset. the 4-7-8 protocol. the physiological sigh. the 5-4-3-2-1 ground. evidence-based techniques that actually lower your heart rate. fits in your pocket.

## result page — outcome 4: "the rebuilder"

> tag: `quiz-rebuild` → maps to "steady" ($15) or "the complete grounding collection" ($47)

### result headline

you're the rebuilder.

### result body

you've been in this for a while. the acute grief has softened into something quieter — but the rebuilding feels endless. some days you're hopeful. some days you're hollow. most days you're both.

you don't need someone to tell you it gets better. you need structure. something that meets you where you are and walks with you through the long middle.

### what this means for your practice

your starting point isn't crisis intervention. it's **sustained practice**. a structure that holds you through the weeks when motivation disappears and all you have left is the routine.

### your recommended starting point

**"steady"** — a 12-week guided reflection practice for the long middle.

weekly themes. daily grounding words. structured reflection prompts. analog activities (yes, things that don't involve a screen). built for the part nobody prepared you for — the part where you're not in crisis anymore, but you're not okay yet either.

$15 · printable · instant download

**[get steady →]**

### want everything?

**"the complete grounding collection"** ($47) — all 8 workbooks, 404 pages, every stage of the journey. grief. identity. daily practice. interviews. the slow rebuild. all of it.

67% less than buying individually.

## thank-you page (after email submission — all outcomes)

### headline

check your inbox.

### body

your grounding profile + free 5-day practice are on their way.

a few things to know:

- the PDF is printable. grab a pen. do it on paper — handwriting activates emotional processing centers that typing can't reach.
- the practice takes about 2 minutes a day. that's it.
- your first email will arrive in the next few minutes. if it doesn't show up, check your spam folder and move it to your primary inbox.

you took the first step. that counts.

— Christie
