### cold ad 1: permission hook (carousel — A/B test variant A)

**slide 1 (hook)**
you don't have to know what's next.

**slide 2**
you don't have to have an answer
when someone asks
"so what are you doing now?"

**slide 3**
you don't have to perform recovery
for the people watching.

**slide 4**
you just have to be honest
about where you actually are.

**slide 5 (CTA)**
find your grounding practice —
a 2-minute self-assessment that meets you
where you are. not where you think you should be.

**caption:**
you don't have to have it figured out today.

I made a free self-assessment that tells you exactly where to start — based on what you're actually carrying right now. not career advice. not hustle culture. just a quiet inventory of what's true.

that feeling has a name.
and you're not broken for having it.

**slide 5 (CTA)**
find out what your feeling is called —
and exactly where to start.

### cold ad 5: neuroscience hook (single image)

**image**: clean text on cream background, brand font

**text on image:**
handwriting activates emotional processing centers that typing can't reach.

naming emotions reduces amygdala activation by up to 50%.

structured reflection reduces cortisol by 25%.

this isn't vibes. it's neuroscience.

**caption:**
I built grounding workbooks based on this research — printable, evidence-based, designed for people who need tools, not motivation.

but first: which one do you actually need?

### cold ad 6: origin story hook (reel — 45 sec)

**format**: talking head, natural light, quiet, personal

**[you, speaking to camera]**

I want to tell you why I made this.

last year, someone close to me got laid off. and the thing that surprised me wasn't the job loss. it was the identity loss.

they kept saying "I'm fine." but at 2am they were scrolling — not job boards. just... looking for something. anything that made them feel less alone.

and I realized: there's career advice everywhere. there's therapy. but there's nothing for the space between — the "who am I now?" question that nobody talks about.

so I built grounding practices for that space. printable. evidence-based. private. designed for 2am.

and I made a self-assessment to help you find the right starting point. 6 questions. 2 minutes. no judgment.

### retargeting ad 3: objection handler (reel — 20 sec)

the job hunt works better
when you're not running from yourself.

15 minutes with a pen.
then go send the applications.

this isn't instead of the search.
it's what makes the search bearable.

## creative production notes

### what Christie needs to create

- **carousel slides**: design in Canva using brand template (cream background, navy text, amber accents)
- **reel footage**: film cold ads 3 and 6 (talking head + text overlays)
- **workbook page photos**: photograph actual printed workbook pages for peek-inside ads (natural light, kitchen table, pen nearby — "stolen moment" aesthetic)
- **story ads**: create in Canva stories template (9:16 vertical)

### what to avoid in creative

- stock photos (always)
- bright colors or polished aesthetics (break the quiet brand energy)
- faces showing big smiles (sam isn't smiling at 2am)
- "before and after" framing (implies sam is broken)
- any text in ALL CAPS (too loud for the brand voice)
