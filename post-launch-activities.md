## week 1 post-launch (feb 17-23)

### beacons link-in-bio setup

your beacons page is the bridge between IG content and your funnel. set it up before your first post goes live.

**links to include (in this order):**

1. **free grounding practice** — link to Kit landing page (luminous-pulse.kit.com) or luminouspulse.co
   - label: "free 5-day grounding practice"
   - this is the top link. it drives email captures.
2. **$9 emergency grounding kit** — link to Kit Commerce product page
   - label: "the emergency grounding kit — $9"
3. **$37 luminous pulse practice** — link to Kit Commerce product page
   - label: "the 30-day practice — $37"
4. **website** — luminouspulse.co
   - label: "luminouspulse.co"
5. **blog** (when published) — link to your first blog post
   - label: "read: who am I without my job?"

**design:**
- background: navy (#1a1a2e)
- accent: amber (#F4C430)
- font: clean sans-serif (closest to Helvetica Neue available)
- profile photo: sanctuary logo (same as IG)
- bio text: use IG bio copy from `instagram-bio-copy.md` Option 1

**tip:** beacons lets you embed a Kit form directly. consider embedding the free practice signup form as the first block instead of just a link — captures emails without leaving the page.

---

### re-upload updated PDFs to Kit

all three PDFs were regenerated on feb 16 with QA fixes:

1. **$37 product** — upload new `30-Day-Luminous-Pulse-Practice.pdf` (removed "Created by Christie Parrow" from cover)
2. **$9 product** — upload new `Emergency-Grounding-Kit.pdf` (removed free practice offer from page 15, replaced with follow CTA)
3. **free product** — upload new `5-Day-Grounding-Practice.pdf` (regenerated fresh)

---

### ManyChat DM automation

set up the GROUNDED keyword trigger:

1. create automation: when someone DMs "GROUNDED" → auto-reply with a grounding affirmation + link to free practice
2. suggested auto-reply:

```
hey — here's your grounding word for today:

"there is something in you that change cannot touch."

say it out loud. once more. feel it land.

want 5 days of this? grab the free grounding practice:
[kit landing page link]

you are held. 💛
```

3. test it from a second account before going live

---

### seed the IG grid

before your first "real" post, get 6-9 posts on the grid so the profile doesn't look empty when people visit:

- use the content calendar week 1 plan (quote cards from `post-captions.md`)
- post all 6-9 seed posts on launch day or the day before
- schedule remaining week 1 content via Metricool

---

### publish first blog posts

three blog posts are written and ready:

1. `blog-post-1-identity-crisis.md` — "Who Am I Without My Job?"
2. `blog-post-2-affirmations-after-layoff.md` — "25 Grounding Affirmations After Getting Laid Off"
3. `blog-post-3-ai-replacing-job-anxiety.md` — "AI Is Replacing Your Job? 7 Grounding Strategies"

**before publishing:**
- add source citations to all statistics (flagged in QA audit)
- vary the origin story phrasing across posts so it doesn't feel identical
- add schema markup per `seo-content-strategy.md`

---

## weeks 2-4 post-launch

### post-purchase email for $37 product

**this is the highest-priority missing content.** someone just spent $37. what happens next?

write a 3-email onboarding sequence:

| email | timing | purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | immediate | "your practice is here." — delivery + how to start Day 1. warm, excited, brief. |
| 2 | day 3 | "how's day 3?" — check in. validate if it feels hard. share one tip for making it stick. |
| 3 | day 10 | "you're almost through the first theme." — celebrate progress. tease what's coming in theme 2. |

**voice:** same sanctuary energy. lowercase. "you made a beautiful decision" not "thanks for your purchase."

---

### weekly newsletter strategy

after the nurture sequence ends (day 21), subscribers enter the weekly newsletter. define it now:

**format:** one email per week. short. 150-250 words.

**structure:**
- one grounding word or affirmation for the week
- one reflection question
- one thing worth reading / watching / listening to (curated, not always your own content)
- P.S. with soft product mention or community prompt

**subject line style:** lowercase, personal. "a grounding word for your week" / "something I've been thinking about" / "this one's for the quiet mornings"

**sending day:** sunday evening or monday morning (aligns with "Monday Ground" IG series)

---

### signature weekly series (from IG research)

implement these recurring content formats:

| series | day | format | description |
|--------|-----|--------|-------------|
| Monday Ground | monday | quote card | one grounding affirmation. same template every week. amber on navy. recognizable instantly. |
| Midweek Check-In | wednesday | IG Story | interactive — polls, sliders. "how are you feeling?" "what do you need this week?" |
| Permission Slip Friday | friday | quote card or carousel | weekly "permission" displaced workers need to hear. branded hashtag: #PermissionSlipFriday |
| Sanctuary Sunday | sunday | carousel or Reel | longer reflection, journal prompt, or mini-meditation |
| Transition Stories | bi-weekly | carousel | real stories from community members. before/during/after format. |

**start with Monday Ground and Permission Slip Friday** — they're the simplest to template and the most brandable.

---

### content quality improvements (from QA audit)

these are non-urgent but should happen in the first month:

1. **affirmation bank curation** (`affirmations-150.md`)
   - deduplicate near-duplicates (e.g., "my creativity runs on living" appears twice)
   - review Theme 1 for affirmations that center AI as the topic rather than the human
   - grow Themes 4 and 5 from 20/15 to 25-30 each
   - fix title count (says "170+" but actual count is 155)

2. **carousel differentiation** (`carousel-slide-copy.md`)
   - rename Carousel 5 to differentiate from Carousel 2 (both are "5 Grounding Words for..." morning formats)

3. **reel script trimming** (`reel-and-live-scripts.md`)
   - trim Reel 3 by 15-20% — too much text for 60 seconds at natural pace
   - add note at top of Live scripts: "use these as guides, not scripts. key phrases are bolded."

4. **LinkedIn post fixes** (`linkedin-posts.md`)
   - source or qualify the "873 tech workers" statistic in Post 3
   - change "tech workers" to "workers" in Post 6 body copy (keep #techlayoffs for distribution)

5. **brand positioning cleanup** (`brand-positioning.md`)
   - resolve "tech professionals" vs "workers" language
   - tighten elevator pitch to 75-85 words (currently runs ~45 seconds)
   - declare primary tagline. recommendation: "come home to what is true about you."

6. **brand voice guide additions** (`brand-voice-guide.md`)
   - add "Handling Pushback" section with example responses to negative comments
   - clarify: affirmations use "I," supporting copy uses "you"

## month 2+ post-launch

### TikTok strategy

TikTok is a separate beast from IG. the algorithm rewards different content, and the audience expects different energy.

**account setup:**
- handle: @luminouspulse.co (already claimed)
- bio: same as IG bio, adapted for TikTok character limits
- link: beacons page

**content adaptation from IG:**
- IG Reels → TikTok as-is (cross-post the video, rewrite the caption)
- carousel content → narrated slideshow format (TikTok's photo mode or green screen)
- quote cards → "POV" format with text overlay on ambient video

**TikTok-native formats:**
- **"grounding in real time"** — film yourself doing the 2-minute practice. no editing. raw. TikTok rewards authenticity over polish.
- **"things no one tells you about getting laid off"** — text-on-screen listicle. short, punchy. 15-30 seconds.
- **"gentle reminders"** — soft-spoken voiceover over ambient footage. calming energy stands out in a chaotic feed.
- **"reply to comments"** — stitch/duet viral layoff content with grounding exercises. this is the fastest growth lever on TikTok.
- **"the silent scroll"** — text-only, no audio, slow transitions. plays on the "watch in silence" trend.

**posting cadence:** 3-5x per week. TikTok rewards consistency more than IG does.

**hashtags:** #layoff #techlayoffs #grounding #mentalhealth #careeradvice #jobsearch #affirmations #healing

**key difference from IG:** TikTok is discovery-first. people find you through the For You page, not by following you. optimize every video's first 1-2 seconds for strangers, not followers. hook harder than you do on IG.

**when to start:** after week 2 of IG launch. don't split focus on launch week.

---

### Pinterest strategy

Pinterest is a long-tail search engine, not a social network. content posted today can drive traffic for 6-18 months.

**account setup:**
- business account: Luminous Pulse
- profile: sanctuary logo
- bio: "grounding practices for displaced workers. free 5-day practice at luminouspulse.co"
- claim website: luminouspulse.co

**boards to create:**

| board | description | pin sources |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| grounding affirmations | affirmations for displaced workers, career anxiety, and uncertain times | quote cards from IG |
| breathwork & grounding exercises | breathwork tutorials, 5-4-3-2-1 technique, body-based grounding | carousel slides, blog graphics |
| career transition support | resources for navigating layoffs, job loss, and career change | blog posts, infographics |
| journal prompts for healing | writing prompts for processing job loss, identity shifts, and change | lead magnet content, new designs |
| permission slips | things you have permission to feel, do, and not do during a career transition | Permission Slip Friday content |
| the sanctuary | brand aesthetic, navy + amber palette, calming visuals | mood board, brand imagery |

**pin strategy:**
- **repurpose every IG quote card as a pin.** resize to 1000x1500px (2:3 ratio). add "luminouspulse.co" at the bottom.
- **every blog post = 3-5 pins.** create different title treatments and images for the same post.
- **idea pins (multi-page):** repurpose carousel content. same slides, Pinterest-optimized text.
- **link every pin** to luminouspulse.co, the Kit landing page, or a blog post.

**SEO for Pinterest:**
- pin titles: use search-friendly language. "grounding affirmation for job loss anxiety" not "you are held"
- pin descriptions: 2-3 sentences with keywords. include "free grounding practice" and link.
- board descriptions: keyword-rich. "grounding affirmations and breathwork exercises for people navigating layoffs, career transitions, and professional displacement."

**posting cadence:** 5-10 pins per week. use Metricool or Tailwind to schedule.

**when to start:** after week 3 of IG launch. Pinterest content is evergreen — no urgency, but the earlier you start, the earlier it compounds.

---

### FAQ / about page

reduce friction for new visitors. add to luminouspulse.co or as a beacons page.

**questions to answer:**
- what is luminous pulse?
- is this therapy?
- is this religious or spiritual?
- who is this for?
- who created this?
- what's in the free practice?
- what's in the paid practice?
- how is this different from other affirmation accounts?
- can I share this with someone?

**voice:** same brand voice. lowercase. warm. direct.

---

### supporter audience content

**high-search, low-competition topic** (flagged in QA audit):

"how to support someone going through a layoff" — content aimed at friends, partners, family members who don't know what to say.

formats:
- blog post (SEO play)
- carousel: "5 things to say to someone who just got laid off (and 5 things not to say)"
- shareable quote card: "for the person supporting someone through this"
- email to existing subscribers: "know someone going through it? forward this."

this creates a second entry point to the brand — people searching for how to help someone else.

---

### referral / sharing mechanism

currently the only "share this" prompt is a P.S. in emails. formalize it:

1. **add "share with someone who needs this" CTA** to the end of the free PDF (page 10)
2. **create a dedicated "send this to a friend" email** in the nurture sequence or as a standalone broadcast
3. **create shareable IG Story templates** — followers screenshot and reshare with their own story
4. **branded hashtag:** #MySanctuaryMoment or #LuminousPulseJourney for community shares

---

### collaboration outreach (month 2-3)

from IG research — start reaching out after you have 20-30 posts and a consistent visual identity:

- career coaches (grounding + strategy co-content)
- therapists specializing in career grief
- HR professionals / outplacement services
- adjacent wellness/mindfulness accounts for content swaps
- duet/react to viral "I just got laid off" content with grounding exercises

use templates from `influencer-outreach-templates.md`.

---

### SEO content pipeline (months 2-6)

three pillar posts are written. continue with supporting articles per `seo-content-strategy.md`:

**month 2:**
- "Laid Off from Tech? Your 30-Day Mental Health and Action Plan"

**month 3:**
- "Rebuilding Professional Identity After Layoff"
- "The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique for Career Anxiety"

**month 4+:**
- remaining cluster articles (9 total remaining)
- interlink everything to pillar posts

---

- **"crisis toolkit" PDF** — TIPP + physiological sigh + butterfly hug + grounding ($5-9)
- **pre-interview grounding guide** — specific to interview anxiety ($9)
- **seasonal practice bundles** — moon cycles, solstice/equinox ($15)
