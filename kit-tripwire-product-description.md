## Product Title

The Emergency Grounding Kit — For the Moment Everything Shifts

## Short Description

10 emergency grounding cards, guided breathwork, and a permission slip for the hardest days. For when you need something to hold onto right now.

---

## Full Product Description

**you just got the news. or maybe you're waiting for it.**

either way, you need something right now — not a 30-day journey, not a course, not a "just upskill" pep talk.

you need one steady thing to hold onto while the ground shifts.

**the Emergency Grounding Kit is that thing.**

**what's inside:**

- 10 emergency grounding cards — each one written for a specific moment in the displaced worker experience (the Slack notification, the 2am spiral, the identity crisis, the morning after another round of layoffs hits your feed)
- a guided breathwork script (the 4-7-8 Reset) for when your chest tightens and your mind races
- a printable permission slip — to feel all of it, take your time, and not have the answers yet

**these are not generic affirmations.** they name the exact feeling:

> *"My layoff is not a performance review. It is a business decision that happened to me."*

> *"I do not need to have an answer when someone asks what I'm doing next."*

> *"The job market is brutal right now. That is not a reflection of my talent."*

**how to use:**

1. open this when the spiral starts
2. pick the card that speaks to where you are right now
3. read it aloud — your voice anchors you
4. use the 4-7-8 breathwork to reset your nervous system
5. come back as many times as you need

you don't need a plan right now. you need ground beneath your feet.

**$9. yours instantly. yours forever.**

**your 5-Day Grounding Practice is on its way to your inbox.**

while you wait — I made something for the harder days.

the free practice is a daily rhythm. but some days don't follow a rhythm. some days the news hits and you need something *right now*.

**the Emergency Grounding Kit** was written for those days.

- 10 emergency grounding cards for the specific moments that knock you sideways (the Slack notification, the 2am spiral, the LinkedIn scroll, the "what are you doing next?" question)
- a breathwork script you can use anywhere
- a permission slip to feel all of it without rushing to "move on"

this isn't a course. it's a first-aid kit for your nervous system.

**$9. yours instantly.**

**Subject**: Your Emergency Kit is here. Breathe.

**Body**:

hey —

your Emergency Grounding Kit is attached.

here's what I want you to do right now: scroll to Page 3. that's the 4-7-8 breathwork script. try it once. just once.

then when you need one of the 10 cards — and you will — open this PDF and find the one that matches where you are. read it out loud. your voice anchors you more than your eyes do.

the permission slip on Page 14? print it. put it somewhere you'll see it on the hard days.

you don't need a plan today. you just need ground beneath your feet.

I'm building more of this — a full 30-day practice, a community, guided sessions. but for now, this is yours.

breathe. you are held.

with you in this,
Christie

P.S. — If one of the 10 cards hits different, I'd love to hear which one. Just reply to this email.
