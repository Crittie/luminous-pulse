## Brand Reframe Checklist (Priority Order)

Everything below needs to happen before launch content goes live. These are all consequences of the brand reframe from "AI affirmations" to "sanctuary for humans navigating uncertain times."

### Immediate (You Do)

- [ ] **Upload Sanctuary logo as IG profile photo** — Use `logo-ig-profile.png` (optimized for circular crop)
- [ ] **Update Instagram bio** — Use copy from `instagram-bio-copy.md` (Option A recommended). Update name field to "Luminous Pulse | Grounding for Uncertain Times"
- [ ] **Update website (luminouspulse.co)** — New hero copy, tagline, about section. Use `brand-positioning.md` and `lead-magnet-landing-page-copy.md` for copy
- [ ] **Create new lead magnet PDF** — "The 5-Day Grounding Practice" replaces "7 AI-Age Affirmation Cards." Include: 5 grounding affirmations, 5 reflection prompts, breathwork guide, morning practice guide. Use content from `affirmations-150.md` (pick 5 strongest from across themes)
- [ ] **Set up Kit form for lead magnet** — Create a form in Kit with email capture. Set up incentive email to auto-deliver the PDF when someone subscribes. This replaces Gumroad for the free product — Kit handles everything
- [ ] **Create Kit Commerce paid product** — "The Luminous Pulse Practice: 30 Days of Grounding for Uncertain Times." Price: $37. Description from `kit-product-description.md`. Upload cover image (once generated)
- [ ] **Update Kit welcome sequence** — Paste new copy from `welcome-email-sequence.md`. 2 emails: Day 2 and Day 5. From name: "Christie at Luminous Pulse." Update tags
- [ ] **Set up Kit nurture sequence** — Paste new copy from `email-nurture-sequence.md`. 5 emails: Day 7, 10, 14, 17, 21. Set trigger: welcome-sequence-complete AND NOT paid-customer
- [ ] **Update Kit tags** — Ensure these exist: `welcome-sequence-complete`, `nurture-sequence-complete`, `paid-customer`, `interested-paid-product`
- [ ] **Update Kit automation rules** — See bottom of `email-nurture-sequence.md` for exact trigger logic
- [ ] **Update ManyChat** — Change DM trigger keyword from "DAILY" to "GROUNDED"
- [ ] **Set up Beacons link-in-bio** — Links: Free grounding practice (Kit form), Website, IG Highlights. Use copy from `lead-magnet-landing-page-copy.md` (link-in-bio section)
- [ ] **Update Canva templates** — Replace any "AI affirmations" / "affirmations for the AI age" text with new language. Update CTA text to "Free grounding practice" instead of "Free affirmation deck"
- [ ] **Update Story Highlight covers** — If any say "AI affirmations," replace with new branding
- [ ] **Set up Metricool** — For content scheduling (replaces Buffer)
- [ ] **Test full funnel** — Subscribe with test email → verify PDF delivery via Kit incentive email → verify welcome sequence → verify nurture sequence → verify Kit Commerce paid product link works

### Immediate (Claude Code Does)

- [x] **Generate new brand logo identity** — "The Sanctuary" logo created (4 options, winner selected)
- [x] **Generate IG profile-optimized logo** — `logo-ig-profile.png` ready
- [ ] **Generate Kit product cover images** — Free product + paid product covers
- [ ] **Generate background images** — For quote cards and content (sanctuary aesthetic)

### Before Launch Content

- [ ] **Design 5-8 Canva templates** — With new sanctuary aesthetic and language
- [ ] **Create first 9 grid posts** — Using new quote card captions from `post-captions.md`
- [ ] **Film Reels** — Using new scripts from `reel-and-live-scripts.md`
- [ ] **Pre-schedule 2 weeks of content** — Using `content-calendar.md` in Metricool

| Engagement rate | 5%+ | Not Started |
| Organic followers | 50+ | Not Started |
