## Email 1: The Story (Day 7)

**Subject**: what I wish someone told me about this feeling

**Preview text**: It wasn't a tool that scared me. It was a meeting.

---

Hey,

I want to tell you something I haven't shared publicly.

Last year I was in a meeting where my manager pulled up a demo of a tool that could do — in 45 seconds — something that took me two days to produce.

Nobody in the room looked at me. But I felt it.

That night I went home and spiraled. Not about the tool. About what I was worth without the thing I thought made me valuable.

And here's what I figured out over the next few weeks: the spiral wasn't about AI. It was about identity. I had tied my worth to my output — and when a machine matched my output, I didn't know who I was without it.

That's the real crisis nobody talks about. It's not a skills gap. It's an identity gap.

The grounding words I write aren't about ignoring what's happening or pretending everything is fine. They're about remembering who you are underneath what you produce. The part of you that loves, that cares, that shows up even when it's hard.

If you've ever felt that unnamed heaviness after reading a headline — you're not broken. You're human. And that's the whole point.

More soon,
Christie

P.S. — If you haven't tried saying one of the grounding affirmations out loud yet, today's a good day. Start with: *"There is something in me that change cannot touch. Today, I remember it."*

## Email 2: Value-First (Day 10)

**Subject**: 3 grounding words for your work week

**Preview text**: Pin one to your desk. Say it before your first meeting.

---

Hey,

Monday energy incoming. Here are three grounding words to carry into your week — one for each vibe:

**If the future feels heavy:**
> *"I will not panic about a future I am actively building."*

**If imposter syndrome is loud:**
> *"I can learn any tool. No tool can learn to be me."*

**If you need permission to slow down:**
> *"I do not need to optimize my morning. I need to feel it."*

Pick one. Write it on a sticky note. Put it where you'll see it before your first meeting.

The practice is simple: read it, say it out loud once, and move on with your day. Two seconds. That's all it takes to shift the energy.

These three are from the full practice — 30 days of grounding affirmations, reflection prompts, and breathwork for uncertain times. If the free 5-day practice has been working for you, the full practice is the next step.

But for now — just pick one of these three and try it tomorrow morning.

Talk soon,
Christie

P.S. — Which one did you pick? Reply and tell me. I'm genuinely curious which one lands for you.

## Email 3: The Full Practice (Day 14)

**Subject**: the full practice is here

**Preview text**: 30 days. Grounding affirmations. Breathwork. Reflection prompts.

---

Hey,

Two weeks ago you started a 5-day grounding practice. I hope at least one of those words has found a permanent spot on your desk or your mirror.

Today I want to share what's behind those 5 days.

I spent months writing, testing, and refining a complete practice: **The Luminous Pulse Practice: 30 Days of Grounding for Uncertain Times.**

It's organized into five themes:

**Remember Who You Are** — for the moments when you wonder where you fit
**Name the Feeling** — for the days when the anxiety is loud and you need someone to say "I see you"
**Ground Yourself** — morning practices for starting your day anchored, not rattled
**You Are Not Alone** — reminders that you are held, even when it doesn't feel like it
**The World We're Building** — grounded hope for the future you're helping create

Every day has a grounding affirmation, a reflection prompt, a breathwork exercise, and a journaling question. That's the part that makes this more than a card deck. It's a practice. A daily act of coming home to yourself.

**The full practice is $37.**

> **[Get The Luminous Pulse Practice → Link to Kit Commerce product]**

By Day 30, you will have a personal framework for navigating uncertainty with power and presence. Come back to it in a month and notice which affirmations hit differently than they did on Day 1.

That's when you'll know it's working.

You are held,
Christie

P.S. — If $37 is tough right now, no pressure at all. The free 5-day practice is yours forever and the weekly grounding words I share are always free. This is here when you're ready.

## Email 4: Social Proof (Day 17)

**Subject**: "I didn't think this kind of thing was for me"

**Preview text**: What I keep hearing from people who tried the practice.

---

Hey,

I want to share something I've been hearing a lot:

*"I didn't think affirmations were for me. I thought they were too woo-woo. But these actually name what I'm feeling. They meet me where I am."*

That response keeps coming up — from engineers, PMs, designers, marketers, teachers. People who would never describe themselves as "affirmation people."

And I get it. Most affirmation content feels like it was written in a different decade. "I am abundant." "I attract success." Those don't land when you're wondering whether the world you planned for still exists.

That's exactly why I made this different.

Every grounding word in the practice was written for a specific feeling:
- The feeling after reading another scary headline
- The feeling before a meeting where you're not sure you're needed
- The feeling at 11pm when you're scrolling and your chest is tight and you don't know who to talk to about it

This is a practice for real life. Your life. Right now.

> **[Get The Luminous Pulse Practice → $37 → Link to Kit Commerce product]**

If the free 5 days already changed how you start your morning, imagine what 30 could do.

More soon,
Christie

P.S. — If you've been using the free practice and have a favorite grounding word, I'd love to hear which one. Just reply — every response makes my day.

## Email 5: Last Chance (Day 21)

**Subject**: last day at this price

**Preview text**: The launch price goes away tomorrow.

---

Hey,

Quick note — the launch price for The Luminous Pulse Practice ends tomorrow.

After that, it goes from $37 to $47.

I'm not going to write a long email about this. You already know if this practice works for you. You've had the free 5 days for three weeks.

If they've helped, the full 30-day practice is the obvious next step. Grounding affirmations. Reflection prompts. Breathwork. Journaling questions. A daily practice of coming home to yourself in a world that wants you everywhere else.

> **[Get the practice at $37 before the price goes up → Link to Kit Commerce product]**

If now's not the right time, that's completely fine. I'll keep showing up in your inbox with free grounding words and the occasional honest story about what it's like to be human in a world that's changing fast.

Either way — you are held. Don't forget it.

Christie

P.S. — After this, I won't pitch the practice again for a while. We'll go back to our regular programming: grounding words, reflections, and the occasional reminder that your humanity is not the problem. It is the answer.
