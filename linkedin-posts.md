## Post 1 — Vulnerability Story: "The Meeting"

I was in a meeting last year where someone casually said, "We'll just have AI do that part."

They were talking about the part of the project I was most proud of.

Nobody looked at me. But I felt it.

That night I couldn't sleep. And I realized — the spiral wasn't about the tool. It was about identity. I had tied my worth to my output. And when a machine matched my output, I didn't know who I was without it.

That's the thing nobody's talking about.

It's not a skills gap. It's an identity gap.

So I started writing grounding words. Not to ignore what's happening. But to remember what's true about me underneath what I produce.

If you've ever felt that unnamed heaviness — you're not alone.

Your humanity is not the problem. It is the answer.

I'm building something for the people carrying this weight. It's called Luminous Pulse. More soon.

## Post 2 — Validation: "The 2am Scroll"

If you're refreshing LinkedIn at 2am — you don't need a career coach.

You need someone to tell you that the pit in your stomach is a normal response to an abnormal situation.

430,000+ tech workers have been displaced since 2024.

And the advice most of them get is: "Just upskill." "Pivot into AI." "Have you tried networking more?"

Nobody asks: "How are you actually doing?"

So let me ask.

How are you actually doing?

Because the job search is hard. But the identity crisis underneath it is harder.

And if nobody's said it to you yet:

Your layoff was not a performance review. It was a spreadsheet decision made in a room you were never invited to.

You're not broken. You're paying attention.

## Post 3 — Data + Insight: "873 Per Day"

873 tech workers are being displaced every single day in 2026.

That's 6,111 per week. 26,000 per month.

Most of them will hear: "The market will bounce back." "Have you updated your resume?" "Consider a career pivot."

Almost none of them will hear: "It's okay to not have a plan yet."

Here's what I've learned talking to people going through this:

The hardest part isn't the job search. It's the 3am question: "Who am I without my title?"

That's not a career problem. That's an identity problem. And no resume workshop fixes it.

I started Luminous Pulse because I went through it myself. Grounding practices specifically for tech professionals navigating displacement. Not generic positivity. Not doom. Honest hope for the crisis underneath the career crisis.

If you know someone carrying this weight, send them this post. Sometimes the most helpful thing is knowing you're not the only one.

## Post 4 — Vulnerability Story: "The Badge"

The worst part wasn't the meeting.

It was walking out of the building and realizing my badge didn't work anymore.

I stood there for 10 seconds holding it against the reader like something was wrong with the machine. But nothing was wrong with the machine. Something was wrong with my reality.

Three hours earlier I had a title, a team, and a desk with a monitor I'd arranged just right.

Now I was standing in a parking lot holding a piece of plastic that used to mean something.

If you've had that moment — or something like it — I want you to know:

Your worth was set long before your badge access was revoked.

The person who cared about their team? Still here.
The person who stayed late because they actually gave a damn? Still here.
The person people went to when things got hard? Still here.

None of that got laid off. None of that expires.

---

## Post 5 — Validation: "The Advice Problem"

The most unhelpful thing you can say to someone who just got laid off:

"Everything happens for a reason."

Here's what actually helps:

"That sounds really hard."
"You don't have to know what's next."
"Can I bring you coffee?"
"Your feelings about this are valid — all of them."

And if you're the one going through it:

You are allowed to be angry at a company you loved.
You are allowed to feel relieved and guilty about the relief.
You are allowed to not update your LinkedIn for a week. Or a month.
You are allowed to grieve a job even if you weren't happy there.

Grief is not a failure of mindset. It's proof that you cared.

If you want grounding words for the hardest days — I built a free 5-day practice for exactly this moment. Link in my bio.

## Post 6 — Data + Insight: "The Identity Gap"

Everyone's talking about the skills gap.

Nobody's talking about the identity gap.

When you spend 10 years building expertise in something — and then a tool does it in 30 seconds — the logical response is: "Cool, I'll learn the tool."

The emotional response is: "Wait. If a machine can do what I do... who am I?"

That second question is the one that keeps people up at night. And no LinkedIn Learning course answers it.

Here's what I believe:

The people who thrive through this shift won't be the ones who learned the most tools. They'll be the ones who know who they are underneath what they produce.

That's the real work. Not upskilling. Re-grounding.

I write grounding words for tech workers navigating this exact moment. Because the identity crisis is the career crisis — and nobody's treating it that way.

## Post 7 — Grounding Practice: "Before Your Next Meeting"

Before your next meeting today, try this:

1. Close your laptop for 30 seconds
2. Put both feet flat on the floor
3. Take one deep breath — in through the nose, out through the mouth
4. Say this silently: "I am whole before I open my laptop."
5. Open the laptop. Begin.

That's it. 30 seconds.

The feeling follows the words. Not the other way around.

If you want a full 5-day practice like this — I built one specifically for professionals navigating uncertain times. It's free. Link in my bio.

## Post 8 — Vulnerability Story: "What I Tell Myself"

This is what I tell myself on the hard mornings:

"I do not need to optimize my morning. I need to feel it."

"My worth was never measured in speed. It is measured in depth."

"I can learn any tool. No tool can learn to be me."

"I give myself permission to navigate this moment with curiosity, not panic."

"There is something in me that change cannot touch. Today, I remember it."

These are called grounding words. I write them because I need them.

If you need them too — I put together a free 5-day grounding practice. Five mornings. Five words. Five moments of stillness before the noise starts.

Link in my bio. It's free because this matters more than money right now.

## Post 9 — Validation: "The Silence"

The hardest part of being laid off isn't the first week.

It's the silence that comes after.

Week 1, people check in. "How are you?" "Need anything?"

Week 3, the texts slow down.

Month 2, you realize nobody's asking anymore. And you're alone with the question you can't answer: "What am I going to do?"

If you're in the silence right now — I see you.

You are not forgotten. You are not falling behind. You are finding your footing.

And the silence is not a sign that people stopped caring. It's just that the world moves on faster than healing does.

Take your time. Your pace is valid.

## Post 10 — Data + Insight: "What Cannot Be Downloaded"

In the last 12 months, I've been thinking about what makes humans irreplaceable.

Not in a Pollyanna way. In a real way.

Here's my list:

- The instinct to pause before saying something that could hurt someone
- The courage to start over after everything falls apart
- The warmth of sitting with someone in silence and making them feel less alone
- The ability to look at a sunset and feel something you can't name
- The stubbornness to keep going when every logical reason says quit

These cannot be downloaded. They cannot be trained on data. They cannot be optimized.

And they are the things the world actually needs more of right now.

If you carry any of these — and you do — you are not replaceable.

## Hashtags (LinkedIn)

Use 3-5, placed at the bottom. LinkedIn hashtags work differently than Instagram — they categorize content for LinkedIn's algorithm.

```
#techlayoffs #careerchange #mentalhealth #techworkers #groundedoptimism
```

Rotate based on post topic. Always include #techlayoffs (highest reach for your audience).
