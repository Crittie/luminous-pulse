## Notes for Curation

- Affirmations marked with existing usage (lead magnet, carousels) should be prioritized for quote cards
- Rate each 1-10 before designing posts — only use 8+ for static quote cards
- 6-7 rated affirmations work well for carousel slides and Story text
- Group complementary affirmations into themed carousel sets of 5-7
- Test different lengths: shorter affirmations (under 15 words) tend to perform best as standalone quote cards
- Longer affirmations (20+ words) work better as carousel slides or Reel text overlays
