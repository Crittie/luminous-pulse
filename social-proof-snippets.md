## Credibility Lines (for About sections, email footers, pitches)

- Created by Christie Parrow — PMP-certified project manager, 7+ years in tech, building a sanctuary at the intersection of humanity and the changing world.
- Luminous Pulse started as a personal practice — words I wrote for myself when the future felt too heavy to carry alone. Now it's a daily practice for thousands of humans finding their ground.
- Not generic positivity. Not doom. Honest hope for the world you're actually living in.
