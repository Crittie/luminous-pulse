**the practice (2 minutes)**

1. Pick one card each morning.
2. Stand up. Posture matters.
3. Take one deep breath.
4. Say the affirmation aloud, three times, slowly.
5. Sit with the feeling for 30 seconds.
6. Reflect using the prompt below the affirmation.

The feeling follows the words. Not the other way around.

*Pin your favorite to your desk, mirror, or laptop lid. Let it find you throughout the day.*
