# Luminous Pulse — Sanctuary Brand for Displaced Workers

## Current Status: PRE-LAUNCH (Launch Date: March 10, 2026)

**Decisions locked:** Faceless brand. Workbooks only. Instagram first. Raw/visceral copy voice. Canva for design. See `strategy/launch-plan-final.md` for the definitive plan.

---

## Brand Identity

- **Name**: Luminous Pulse
- **Handle**: @luminouspulse.co (Instagram, TikTok, X/Twitter, Pinterest)
- **Domain**: luminouspulse.co (hosted on Vercel, deployed via GitHub)
- **Repo**: github.com/Crittie/luminous-pulse
- **Founder**: Christie Parrow — PMP-certified project manager, AI industry professional
- **Positioning**: Where anxious humans come to rest. Grounding for displaced workers in uncertain times.
- **Target audience**: Displaced workers — PMs, engineers, designers, marketers (25-45) navigating layoffs, role elimination, and career disruption. "Workers" not "tech workers" — intentionally broad.
- **Key insight**: The crisis isn't a skills gap. It's an identity gap. "Anxious" is the feeling, "displaced" is the identity, "workers" keeps the door open across professions.

- **Blue**: #6CB4EE
- **Amber**: #F4C430

## Notes for Claude

- **Use lowercase for all brand copy** — captions, emails, subject lines, bios, CTAs, headlines. Lowercase is the brand voice. Only exceptions: "I" and proper nouns (Christie, Luminous Pulse, Kit, Instagram).
- **Pinterest is the exception** — pin descriptions use standard capitalization for SEO discoverability. Not the quiet lowercase brand voice.
- Instagram handle is @luminouspulse.co (not @luminouspulse)
- X/Twitter handle is @luminouspulse.co — same handle across IG, TikTok, X, Pinterest
- "Workers" not "tech workers" — intentionally broad to include all professions
- "Anxious" is the feeling, "displaced" is the identity — both matter
- **Stat-response content formula**: take a cold labor market stat → name the FEELING underneath it. Not career advice. The emotional truth nobody says out loud. This format works across all platforms.
- **Reply-farming on X/Twitter**: engage under viral labor market posts (Kalshi, BLS, layoff trackers). Never link. Never sell. Just name the feeling. The profile click is the conversion.
- Python scripts require `.venv` activation (`source .venv/bin/activate`)
- reportlab style names: avoid "BodyText" and "Italic" (already defined in getSampleStyleSheet)
- Website deploys automatically via Vercel when pushing to main
- Logo background color (#182742) doesn't match website (#1a1a2e) — always use the transparent version
