# Luminous Pulse — Sanctuary Brand for Displaced Workers

## Current Status: Pre-Launch (Content Launch Feb 17, 2026 — Lunar New Year)

**Last Updated:** February 14, 2026

---

## Brand Identity

- **Name**: Luminous Pulse
- **Handle**: @luminouspulse.co (Instagram, TikTok)
- **Domain**: luminouspulse.co (hosted on Vercel, deployed via GitHub)
- **Repo**: github.com/Crittie/luminous-pulse
- **Founder**: Christie Parrow — PMP-certified project manager, AI industry professional
- **Positioning**: Where anxious humans come to rest. Grounding for displaced workers in uncertain times.
- **Target audience**: Displaced workers — PMs, engineers, designers, marketers (25-45) navigating layoffs, role elimination, and career disruption. "Workers" not "tech workers" — intentionally broad.
- **Key insight**: The crisis isn't a skills gap. It's an identity gap. "Anxious" is the feeling, "displaced" is the identity, "workers" keeps the door open across professions.

- **Blue**: #6CB4EE

- Interactive quizzes ("What's your nervous system state?", "Where does your body hold your layoff?")
- Community (Discord/Telegram)

## Notes for Claude

- **Use lowercase for all brand copy** — captions, emails, subject lines, bios, CTAs, headlines. Lowercase is the brand voice. Only exceptions: "I" and proper nouns (Christie, Luminous Pulse, Kit, Instagram).
- Instagram handle is @luminouspulse.co (not @luminouspulse)
- "Workers" not "tech workers" — intentionally broad to include all professions
- "Anxious" is the feeling, "displaced" is the identity — both matter
- Python scripts require `.venv` activation (`source .venv/bin/activate`)
- reportlab style names: avoid "BodyText" and "Italic" (already defined in getSampleStyleSheet)
- Website deploys automatically via Vercel when pushing to main
- Logo background color (#182742) doesn't match website (#1a1a2e) — always use the transparent version
