## Bio Structure Guide

Instagram bios that convert follow these patterns:

**Line 1**: What you are (identity/niche keyword)
**Line 2**: Tagline or value proposition (emotional hook)
**Line 3**: What they get (social proof or content promise)
**CTA**: Link reference (free guide, shop, etc.)

Update the bio as you grow:
- **0-500 followers**: Focus on clarity (Options 1-3)
- **500-2,500 followers**: Add social proof (Option 7)
- **2,500+**: Add credibility markers ("Featured in..." or "As seen on...")

## Name Field Optimization

The **Name field** (not username) is searchable on Instagram. Use it for keywords:

- `[Brand Name] | AI Affirmations`
- `[Brand Name] | Daily Affirmations`
- `[Brand Name] | Mindset for the AI Age`

This helps you appear in search results when people look for "affirmations" or "AI mindset."
