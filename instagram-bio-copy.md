## Bio Structure Guide

Instagram bios that convert follow these patterns:

**Line 1**: Emotional hook that signals "this is for tech people going through it" (why you're here)
**Line 2**: What you offer (content types / value)
**Line 3**: CTA (free resource reference)

Update the bio as you grow:
- **0-500 followers**: Focus on emotional invitation (Options 1-3)
- **500-2,500 followers**: Add social proof (Option 7)
- **2,500+**: Add credibility markers ("Former PMP in tech" or "Featured in...")

## Name Field Optimization

The **Name field** (not username) is searchable on Instagram. Use it for keywords:

- `Luminous Pulse | Grounding for Tech Workers`
- `Luminous Pulse | Career Displacement Healing`
- `Luminous Pulse | Grounding for Uncertain Times`

This helps you appear in search results when people look for "tech layoffs," "career anxiety," "grounding," or "affirmations."
