## Carousel 3: "How to Reframe AI Anxiety"

**Theme**: Anxiety Relief

**Slide 1 (Hook)**
Feeling anxious about AI?

Read this before
your next spiral.

**Slide 2**
The anxiety is normal.
You're watching the world change
in real time.
That's disorienting.

**Slide 3**
But here's what anxiety skips:
You've adapted before.
New tools. New industries.
New ways of working.
You're still here.

**Slide 4**
AI is a tool.
A powerful one.
But a tool doesn't have
your judgment,
your taste,
your instincts.

**Slide 5**
The people who thrive
won't be the ones who fight AI.
They'll be the ones who
use it without losing themselves.

**Slide 6**
Affirmation:
"I navigate change
with steadiness and curiosity.
I have done this before."

**Slide 7**
Affirmation:
"I am not in competition
with technology.
I am in partnership with it."

Come back to it
the next time a headline
tries to scare you.
