hey — I'm glad you're here.

here's your free copy of **The 5-Day Grounding Practice**:

**[Download your practice →]** *(link to PDF)*

it's 5 mornings of grounding affirmations, breathwork, and reflection prompts — designed for the kind of uncertainty that lives in your chest before you even open your laptop.

**a quick suggestion before you start:**

don't just read the affirmations. say them out loud. I know that sounds small, but there's a real difference between reading "I am whole before I open my laptop" and hearing your own voice say it at 7am.

the feeling follows the words. not the other way around.

start tomorrow morning with Day 1. two minutes. feet on the floor. one deep breath. one grounding word.

that's it.

more soon — I'll share the 2-minute practice that makes these words actually land (it's simpler than you think).

you are held,
Christie

P.S. — if you know someone carrying this weight too, send them this link: **luminouspulse.co**. this practice works better when you're not doing it alone.
