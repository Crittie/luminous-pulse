# Brand Voice Guide

## Voice in Three Words

**Warm. Grounded. Defiant.**

- **Warm**: We speak like a supportive friend, not a motivational speaker. Gentle tone, personal language, genuine care.
- **Grounded**: We acknowledge reality. We don't pretend AI isn't changing things. We validate the fear before reframing it.
- **Defiant**: We have a quiet confidence. Not aggressive, but firm. "You can't be replaced" is a statement, not a question.

## Tone Spectrum

```
Aggressive  ---|------X--------  Passive
              Quietly confident

Preachy     ---|------X--------  Casual
              Sincere

Corporate   ---|----------X----  Slang-heavy
              Conversational

Fear-based  ---|------X--------  Toxic positivity
              Honest optimism
```

We sit in the middle — never preachy, never dismissive. We're the voice that says: *"Yeah, this is scary. And you're going to be more than okay."*

## Language Dos

| Do | Example |
|----|---------|
| Use "you" directly | "You are irreplaceable." |
| Acknowledge the fear first | "It's okay to feel uncertain. And also: you adapt." |
| Use present tense | "I grow alongside technology." |
| Use sensory/emotional language | "Feel the steadiness in your own hands." |
| Keep it short (quote cards: 8-15 words) | "My creativity cannot be automated." |
| Use "and" instead of "but" | "AI is powerful *and* so are you." |
| Make affirmations specific | "I bring context, empathy, and judgment that no model can replicate." |
| Vary sentence rhythm | Mix short punchy lines with one longer reflection. |

---

## Language Don'ts

| Don't | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| "Just stay positive!" | Dismisses real anxiety | "It's valid to feel this. Here's what's also true..." |
| "AI will never replace humans" | Overpromises; feels naive | "Your humanity gives you something AI never will." |
| Jargon (LLMs, neural nets, etc.) | Alienates non-tech audience | "AI tools" or "technology" |
| "Hustle harder" / grind culture | Misaligned with brand values | "Move at the pace of trust." |
| All caps for emphasis | Feels aggressive | Use *italics* or line breaks |
| "Don't worry" | Invalidating | "It's natural to wonder. And here's the truth..." |
| Gendered language | Excludes audience | Use "you" and "we" |
| Passive voice in affirmations | Weak, forgettable | "I create" not "creativity is found in me" |
| Sarcasm about AI companies | Risks alienating tech workers | Stay pro-human without being anti-tech |

## Affirmation Writing Rules

1. **Start with "I" or "My"** — first person makes it personal
2. **Present tense only** — "I am," not "I will be"
3. **Positive framing** — "I embrace change" not "I am not afraid of change"
4. **Specific over generic** — "I bring empathy to every meeting" beats "I am enough"
5. **Under 15 words** for quote cards
6. **One idea per affirmation** — don't stack multiple concepts
7. **Read it aloud** — if it doesn't feel good to say, rewrite it

## Voice Check

Before publishing any content, ask:

1. Would a thoughtful friend say this? (If it sounds like a billboard, rewrite.)
2. Does it acknowledge reality before reframing? (No toxic positivity.)
3. Is it specific to our niche? (Could any affirmation account post this? If yes, make it ours.)
4. Does it feel good to read aloud? (Affirmations live in the mouth and body.)
5. Would this make someone screenshot and share? (Shareability = growth.)
