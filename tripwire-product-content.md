## Page 2: When to Use This Kit

**This kit is for right now.**

Not tomorrow. Not when you "have time."

Right now — when the Slack message just landed. When the news broke. When you're lying awake at 2am refreshing LinkedIn. When the pit in your stomach won't go away.

This isn't a 30-day journey. It's a 30-second lifeline.

**How to use:**

1. Open this when you feel the spiral starting
2. Pick the card that speaks to where you are
3. Read it aloud — your voice anchors you
4. Use the breathwork on the next page
5. Come back as many times as you need

You don't need to be okay right now. You just need one steady thing to hold onto.

## Page 3: Emergency Breathwork — The 4-7-8 Reset

**When your chest tightens and your mind races, start here.**

This is not meditation. This is a nervous system reset.

**The 4-7-8 Breath:**

1. **Inhale** through your nose for **4 counts**
   *(Breathe into your belly, not your chest)*

2. **Hold** for **7 counts**
   *(This is where the reset happens — stay with it)*

3. **Exhale** slowly through your mouth for **8 counts**
   *(Let everything out — the fear, the tightness, the what-ifs)*

4. **Repeat 4 times**

After 4 rounds, notice what shifted. Your hands. Your jaw. Your shoulders.

You were just somewhere else. Now you're here.

**When to use this:**
- Before opening your email after a layoff announcement
- When you can't sleep because the future feels too heavy
- Before any conversation about "what's next"
- Anytime the tightness starts

## Page 4: Emergency Card 1

**"I do not have to solve the future in this moment. I just have to breathe through it."**

This card is for the first wave — when the news hits and everything in you wants to fix it immediately.

You don't have to fix it yet. You don't have to know what comes next. Right now, the only job you have is to be here. Breathe. The plan can wait until your hands stop shaking.

---

**"My layoff is not a performance review. It is a business decision that happened to me."**

This card is for the voice that says "Maybe I wasn't good enough."

You were. The spreadsheet didn't know your name. The decision was made in a room you weren't invited to, about numbers you never saw. This is not a reflection of your value. It never was.

---

## Page 6: Emergency Card 3

**"I am allowed to feel the full weight of this before I figure out what's next."**

This card is for the people already telling you to "look on the bright side."

You don't owe anyone optimism right now. Grief is not a failure of mindset. The weight is real. Feel it. Carry it for as long as you need to. The bright side will still be there when you're ready.

---

## Page 7: Emergency Card 4

**"I have survived every hard day I have ever had. My track record is 100%."**

This card is for the 2am spiral.

Pull up your evidence file. The reorg you survived. The pivot you made. The time you started over and built something better. You have done harder things than this. You just can't see it from where you're standing right now.

---

## Page 8: Emergency Card 5

**"My worth was set long before my badge access was revoked."**

This card is for the identity crisis.

You were someone before that title. Before that team. Before that Slack handle. The person who made people laugh in meetings. Who stayed late because they cared, not because they had to. Who noticed when someone was struggling and showed up. That person didn't get laid off. That person is still right here.

---

**"I do not need to have an answer when someone asks what I'm doing next."**

This card is for the small-talk dread.

"So, what are you up to now?" is the most loaded question in the English language when you don't know the answer. Here's your permission: "I'm taking some time to figure that out." That's a complete answer. It's honest. It's enough.

---

## Page 10: Emergency Card 7

**"The job market is brutal right now. That is not a reflection of my talent."**

This card is for the silence after 200 applications.

If you've sent hundreds of applications and heard nothing back — the market is broken, not you. Hiring freezes, AI screening, ghost postings. This is the landscape. Your talent didn't change. The terrain did.

---

**"I am not falling behind. I am finding my footing."**

This card is for when LinkedIn makes you feel like everyone else has it figured out.

They don't. The "Excited to announce" posts are the highlight reel. Behind every polished update is someone who also cried in their car, questioned everything, and ate cereal for dinner. You are exactly where millions of other people are right now. You're just honest about it.

---

## Page 12: Emergency Card 9

**"Breathe first. Plan later. Survive the feeling before you solve the problem."**

This card is for the person making a plan while panicking.

Your nervous system cannot process grief and strategy at the same time. When the fear is loud, your brain cannot think clearly. So stop trying to solve it right now. Breathe. Drink water. Go outside. The plan will be better when you're not making it from a place of terror.

---

## Page 13: Emergency Card 10

**"There is something in me that change cannot touch. Today, I remember it."**

This card is for any day at all.

Underneath the job title, the industry shift, the anxiety, the uncertainty — there is a part of you that remains. Your capacity to love. Your ability to show up for the people who need you. Your stubbornness to keep going. That part doesn't care about the job market. It was there before this. It will be there after.
