# Hashtag Sets — Luminous Pulse

> **Usage**: 3-5 hashtags per post. Place in the caption (not first comment).
> **Strategy**: Niche, specific hashtags for algorithm categorization. Quality over quantity.
> **Core rule**: Include 1-2 from Set 1 (Brand Core) on every single post.
> **Target audience**: Displaced tech workers, career-disrupted professionals
> **2026 best practice**: Instagram recommends 3-5 hashtags. More can harm reach.

```

---

## Set 3: Human Identity & Worth

## Rules

1. **Always include 1-2 brand core hashtags** (#luminouspulse + #presenceoverpanic or #groundedoptimism)
2. **Place hashtags in the caption**, not in comments (2026 algorithm change)
3. **3-5 total hashtags per post** — never more
4. **Rotate secondary sets** — don't use the same combination on consecutive posts
5. **Use Set 5 (Tech Career) at least 2x/week** — this is how our target audience finds us
6. **Use Set 6 sparingly** — only on posts with strong early engagement to amplify reach
7. **Update monthly** — swap underperforming tags for trending ones via Metricool analytics

## Hashtags to Avoid

| Hashtag | Why |
|---------|-----|
| #aiaffirmations | Sounds like pro-AI content, wrong positioning |
| #techaffirmations | Too narrow, tech-coded in the wrong way |
| #humanovertech | Oppositional framing, keeps AI as protagonist |
| #positivevibesonly | Signals toxic positivity |
| #goodvibes | Too generic, passive audience |
| #manifestation | Different audience, New Age coded |
| #selfcare | Oversaturated, algorithm ignores it |
| #learntocode | Dismissive, "just upskill" energy |
| #hustleculture | Productivity culture is part of the wound |
| #ai / #artificialintelligence | Attracts tech/news audience, not healing audience |
