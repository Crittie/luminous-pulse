## Reel Scripts

### Reel 1: "Your Gut Feeling Is Not a Glitch"
**Format**: Text on screen + trending audio (calm/ambient)
**Duration**: 30 sec
**Best for**: Week 1, Day 5

**[Text on screen, timed to beat]**

Your gut feeling is not a glitch.

It's decades of pattern recognition
running in the background.

No model was trained on
what you've lived through.

No dataset holds
what your body knows.

Your intuition is trained
on a lifetime of being human.

No dataset compares.

### Reel 2: "The Original Intelligence"
**Format**: Text on screen, fast cuts between clips + punchy audio
**Duration**: 30 sec
**Best for**: Week 2, Day 12

**[Text on screen, each line = new cut]**

Every AI model that exists

was trained on what humans created.

Our words.

Our art.

Our ideas.

Our mistakes.

You are not the copy.

You are the source.

**[Hold on screen]**: "I am the original intelligence. Everything else is built in my image."

### Reel 3: "Guided Affirmation — Permission to Not Know"
**Format**: Talking head or voice over calm footage. Slow, intentional pace.
**Duration**: 60 sec
**Best for**: Week 3, Day 19

**[You, speaking to camera or voiceover]**

Take a breath with me.

(pause)

If you've been feeling like you should have all the answers about AI right now — you don't.

Nobody does.

And that's not a failure. That's honesty.

So here's your affirmation for today. Say it with me:

"I give myself permission to not know everything and still be enough."

One more time:

"I give myself permission to not know everything... and still be enough."

Now carry that with you today. And if you need 7 more like this — free affirmation deck in our bio.

### Reel 4: "Why I Started Luminous Pulse"
**Format**: Talking head, personal story, natural lighting
**Duration**: 45-60 sec
**Best for**: Week 4, Day 26

**[You, speaking to camera]**

I started this page because I was tired of two things.

One — AI headlines that are designed to terrify you.

And two — affirmation accounts that pretend the world hasn't changed.

"You are enough" is great. But it doesn't hit the same when you're wondering if a machine is about to do your job.

So I made something different. Affirmations for the world we actually live in. The AI age. The uncertainty. The weird, exciting, scary, beautiful moment we're all in.

Because your humanity is not a limitation. It's your superpower.

And I think you need to hear that more often.

Follow along if that resonates. We're just getting started.

### Reel 5: "Not In Competition"
**Format**: Text on screen, fast cuts + trending audio (upbeat/confident)
**Duration**: 25 sec
**Best for**: Week 3 or 4

**[Text on screen, punchy timing]**

Stop competing with AI.

Start collaborating with it.

You bring judgment.
It brings speed.

You bring empathy.
It brings data.

You bring purpose.
It brings none.

"I am not in competition with technology.
I am in partnership with it."

The energy shift changes everything.

### Reel 6: "POV: An Affirmation That Actually Makes Sense"
**Format**: POV text + trending audio (relatable/funny hook)
**Duration**: 20 sec
**Best for**: Anytime — evergreen

**[Text on screen]**

POV: You finally found an affirmation account
that doesn't pretend AI doesn't exist

**[Cut to quote card]**

"I do not need to know everything about AI to be valuable."

**[Text on screen]**

Because you don't.

**[End card]**: Follow for more like this

---

### Reel 7: "Your Track Record Is 100%"
**Format**: Slow text reveal + ambient/emotional audio
**Duration**: 40 sec
**Best for**: Week 2 or 3

**[Slow text reveal, one line at a time]**

You survived every hard day you've ever had.

Every industry shift.

Every "worst case scenario."

Every moment you thought you wouldn't make it.

Your track record is 100%.

And now you're worried about the next thing.

But the pattern says you'll handle it.

Because you always do.

**[Hold on screen]**: "I have adapted before. I will adapt again."

**[End card]**: Save this for when you need it

### Reel 8: "This Week's Affirmation Hit Different"
**Format**: Talking head, weekly reflection, casual vibe
**Duration**: 45 sec
**Best for**: End of week (Friday/Saturday)

**[You, speaking to camera]**

This week's affirmation that won't leave my head:

"The future belongs to people who know who they are. I am becoming that person."

And here's why it hit different this week.

Everyone's talking about what skills to learn, what tools to master, what certifications to get.

But the people who actually thrive through big changes? They're not the ones with the best tools. They're the ones who know who they are and what they stand for.

That's the real skill.

So this weekend — forget the tools for a second. Ask yourself: what do I stand for?

That's your edge.

Drop your affirmation for the week in the comments. I want to hear it.

### IG Live 1: "Guided Affirmation Session"
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Best for**: Day 21 (Sunday evening, 7pm)
**Promote**: Countdown sticker in Stories starting Day 19

---

**[0:00-2:00] Opening / Welcome**

Hey everyone. Welcome to our first live affirmation session.

If you're just joining — I'm Christie, and this is Luminous Pulse. We make affirmations for the AI age. Not the generic kind. The kind that actually match the world you're living in right now.

Here's how this works. I'm going to guide us through 5 affirmations over the next 15 minutes. For each one, I'll read it, we'll say it together, and then I'll give you a minute to sit with it.

You can do this sitting, standing, wherever you are. If you can, put your phone down and just listen. I'll be right here.

Drop a heart in the chat if you're ready.

---

**[2:00-4:30] Affirmation 1 — Grounding**

Let's start with a breath.

In through the nose... and out through the mouth.

One more.

Good.

Here's your first affirmation. I'll say it, and then you repeat it — out loud if you can.

"I am whole before I open my laptop."

Say it with me:

"I am whole before I open my laptop."

One more time, slower:

"I am whole... before I open... my laptop."

Sit with that for a second. Your worth does not boot up with your computer. It was there when you woke up this morning. It'll be there when you close the screen tonight.

Take a breath. Let that settle.

---

**[4:30-7:00] Affirmation 2 — Empowerment**

Affirmation number two.

"My intuition is trained on a lifetime of being human. No dataset compares."

Your turn:

"My intuition is trained on a lifetime of being human. No dataset compares."

I want you to think about a time your gut was right. When the numbers said one thing, but you knew better. Maybe at work. Maybe in a relationship. Maybe just a feeling you couldn't explain.

That instinct? It wasn't a fluke. It was your lived experience doing what no model can do.

Trust it.

---

**[7:00-9:30] Affirmation 3 — Permission**

Number three. This one's for anyone who's been carrying the weight of keeping up.

"I give myself permission to navigate this moment with curiosity, not panic."

Say it:

"I give myself permission to navigate this moment with curiosity, not panic."

You don't need a five-year plan. You don't need to master every tool. You just need to stay curious. That's the whole strategy.

Let that pressure go for a second. Just be here.

---

**[9:30-12:00] Affirmation 4 — Career**

Affirmation four. For anyone who's ever wondered if they're falling behind.

"I can learn any tool. No tool can learn to be me."

Say it with me:

"I can learn any tool. No tool can learn to be me."

Tools change every six months. You adapt every time. That pattern is your proof. You've never stayed stuck. You've always found the next step.

And this time is no different.

---

**[12:00-14:30] Affirmation 5 — Closing**

Last one. Take a breath first.

"The future belongs to people who know who they are. I am becoming that person."

One more time:

"The future belongs to people who know who they are. I am becoming that person."

Not the fastest person. Not the most connected. The one who knows who they are. That's who you're becoming. Right now. In this moment.

---

**[14:30-17:00] Closing / Engagement**

Take one more breath with me.

In... and out.

Thank you for being here. Seriously. It takes something to stop scrolling and actually sit with these words.

If one of these affirmations hit different — drop it in the chat. I want to know which one you're carrying into the week.

And if you want these on cards you can keep — we have a free 7-card affirmation deck. Link is in our bio. Print them out, pin your favorite to your desk or your mirror. Let it find you throughout the day.

We'll do this again. Same time, same place. Follow @luminouspulse.co so you don't miss the next one.

Your humanity is your superpower. Don't forget it.

See you soon.

### IG Live 2: "Q&A — AI Anxiety Is Normal"
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Best for**: Week 5 or 6
**Promote**: Q&A box in Stories 2 days before ("What's your biggest question about AI and your career?")

---

**[0:00-2:00] Opening**

Hey, welcome back. Today's a little different — I collected your questions from Stories about AI, careers, and all the feelings that come with it.

Quick ground rule: there are no dumb questions here. If you're feeling it, someone else is too. That's why we're doing this.

Let's get into it.

---

**[2:00-5:00] Q1: "Will AI take my job?"**

This is the big one, right? Here's my honest answer.

AI will change your job. Parts of it will get automated. That's already happening.

But the parts that can't be automated? Those are about to matter more than ever. Judgment. Empathy. Reading a room. Building trust. Making the call when the data isn't clear.

Your job is evolving. You are evolving with it. That's different from being replaced.

Affirmation for this: "I have reinvented myself before. I will do it again. This is what I do."

---

**[5:00-8:00] Q2: "How do I stop doomscrolling AI news?"**

I struggle with this too. Here's what works for me:

One — set a time limit. Fifteen minutes of AI news in the morning. That's it.

Two — for every scary headline you read, find one person using AI to do something meaningful. Balance the input.

Three — remember that headlines are optimized for clicks, not truth. Your life is more nuanced than any headline.

Affirmation: "The headlines are designed to scare me. My life is designed to be lived."

---

**[8:00-11:00] Q3: "I feel like a fraud using AI at work"**

You're not a fraud. You're resourceful.

Using a calculator didn't make mathematicians frauds. Using spellcheck didn't make writers frauds. Using AI doesn't make you a fraud.

The value was never in the typing. It was in the thinking. The judgment. The decision of what to create and why.

Affirmation: "I am allowed to use AI without feeling like a fraud — and to not use it without feeling left behind."

---

**[11:00-14:00] Q4: "Should I be learning to code / learning AI tools?"**

Learn what excites you. Not what scares you into action.

If you're curious about AI tools — explore them. Use them. Play with them.

If you're learning out of pure fear — pause. Fear is not a good teacher. Curiosity is.

You do not need to know everything about AI to be valuable. That's not my opinion. That's a fact.

Affirmation: "I am allowed to learn slowly. Mastery and speed are not the same thing."

---

**[14:00-17:00] Closing**

Last thing. I want everyone to take one affirmation from today and keep it somewhere you'll see it this week.

Write it on a sticky note. Set it as your phone wallpaper. Say it in the mirror.

The feeling follows the words. Not the other way around.

If you want all of these on printable cards — free deck in our bio.

Thank you for showing up. Drop your takeaway in the chat. See you next time.
