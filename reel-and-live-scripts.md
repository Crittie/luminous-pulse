### Reel 1: "Your Gut Feeling Is Not a Glitch"
**Format**: Text on screen + trending audio (calm/ambient)
**Duration**: 30 sec
**Pillar**: Remember Who You Are
**Best for**: Week 1, Day 5

**[Text on screen, timed to beat]**

Your gut feeling is not a glitch.

It's decades of pattern recognition
running in the background.

No model was trained on
what you've lived through.

No system holds
what your body knows.

Your intuition was trained
by a lifetime of being alive.

Nothing compares.

### Reel 2: "The Original Intelligence"
**Format**: Text on screen, fast cuts between clips + punchy audio
**Duration**: 30 sec
**Pillar**: Remember Who You Are
**Best for**: Week 2, Day 12

**[Text on screen, each line = new cut]**

Every tool that exists

was built on what humans created.

Our words.

Our art.

Our ideas.

Our capacity to love what we make.

You are not the copy.

You are the source.

**[Hold on screen]**: "I am the original intelligence. Everything else is built in my image."

### Reel 3: "Guided Grounding — Permission to Not Know"
**Format**: Talking head or voice over calm footage. Slow, intentional pace.
**Duration**: 60 sec
**Pillar**: Name the Feeling
**Best for**: Week 3, Day 19

**[You, speaking to camera or voiceover]**

Take a breath with me.

(pause)

If you've been carrying the weight of not knowing what comes next — you're not failing. You're being honest.

Nobody has the answers right now. And that's not a character flaw. That's reality.

So here's your grounding word for today. Say it with me:

"I give myself permission to not know everything and still be enough."

One more time:

"I give myself permission to not know everything... and still be enough."

Now carry that with you today. And if you want a full grounding practice — free 5-day guide in our bio.

### Reel 4: "Why I Started Luminous Pulse"
**Format**: Talking head, personal story, natural lighting
**Duration**: 45-60 sec
**Pillar**: You Are Not Alone
**Best for**: Week 4, Day 26

**[You, speaking to camera]**

I started this because of a feeling I couldn't name.

I was in a meeting last year where someone casually said, "We'll just have AI do that part." They were talking about the part of the project I was most proud of.

Nobody looked at me. But I felt it.

And that night I realized — the spiral wasn't about the tool. It was about identity. I had tied my worth to my output, and when a machine matched my output, I didn't know who I was without it.

That's the real thing nobody's talking about. It's not a skills gap. It's an identity gap.

So I started writing grounding words. Not to ignore what's happening. But to remember what's true about me underneath what I produce.

If you've ever felt that unnamed heaviness — you're not alone. And your humanity is not the problem. It is the answer.

That's what this is. Follow along if it resonates.

### Reel 5: "What Change Cannot Touch"
**Format**: Text on screen, slow reveal + emotional audio
**Duration**: 30 sec
**Pillar**: Remember Who You Are
**Best for**: Week 3 or 4

**[Text on screen, slow reveal]**

The world is changing faster
than we can process.

Jobs are shifting.
Headlines are relentless.
The ground feels unsteady.

But there is something in you
that change cannot touch.

Your capacity to love.
Your ability to show up.
Your stubbornness to keep going.

That part of you is still here.

"There is something in me
that change cannot touch.
Today, I remember it."

that doesn't tell you to "just upskill"
when your entire industry shifted overnight

**[Cut to quote card]**

"I am not broken for feeling anxious.
I am awake in a world
that is changing fast."

**[Text on screen]**

You're not broken.
You're paying attention.

**Duration**: 40 sec
**Pillar**: Name the Feeling
**Best for**: Week 2 or 3

**[Slow text reveal, one line at a time]**

You survived every hard day you've ever had.

Every time the world shifted.

Every "worst case scenario."

Every moment you thought you wouldn't make it.

Your track record is 100%.

And now you're worried about the next thing.

But the pattern says you'll handle it.

Because you always do.

**[Hold on screen]**: "I have adapted before. I will adapt again."

**[End card]**: Save this for when you need it

### Reel 8: "This Week's Grounding Word Hit Different"
**Format**: Talking head, weekly reflection, casual vibe
**Duration**: 45 sec
**Pillar**: The World We're Building
**Best for**: End of week (Friday/Saturday)

**[You, speaking to camera]**

This week's grounding word that won't leave my head:

"The future belongs to people who know who they are. I am becoming that person."

And here's why it hit different this week.

Everyone's talking about what to learn, what to master, what to keep up with.

But the people who actually thrive through big changes? They're not the ones with the best tools. They're the ones who know who they are and what they stand for.

That's the real work.

So this weekend — forget keeping up for a second. Ask yourself: what do I stand for? What's true about me underneath everything else?

That's your edge. That's what no one can take.

Drop your grounding word for the week in the comments. I want to hear it.

### IG Live 1: "Guided Grounding Session"
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Best for**: Day 21 (Sunday evening, 7pm)
**Promote**: Countdown sticker in Stories starting Day 19

---

**[0:00-2:00] Opening / Welcome**

Hey everyone. Welcome to our first live grounding session.

If you're just joining — I'm Christie, and this is Luminous Pulse. We make grounding words for workers navigating uncertain times. Not generic positivity. Not "just upskill" advice. Words that actually meet you where you are right now.

Here's how this works. I'm going to guide us through 5 grounding words over the next 15 minutes. For each one, I'll read it, we'll say it together, and then I'll give you a minute to sit with it.

You can do this sitting, standing, wherever you are. If you can, put your phone down and just listen. I'll be right here.

Drop a heart in the chat if you're ready.

**[2:00-4:30] Grounding Word 1 — Coming Home**

Let's start with a breath.

In through the nose... and out through the mouth.

One more.

Good.

Here's your first grounding word. I'll say it, and then you repeat it — out loud if you can.

"I am whole before I open my laptop."

Say it with me:

"I am whole before I open my laptop."

One more time, slower:

"I am whole... before I open... my laptop."

Sit with that for a second. Your worth does not boot up with your computer. It was there when you woke up this morning. It'll be there when you close the screen tonight.

Take a breath. Let that settle.

---

**[4:30-7:00] Grounding Word 2 — Remembering**

Grounding word number two.

"My intuition was trained by a lifetime of being alive. Nothing compares."

Your turn:

"My intuition was trained by a lifetime of being alive. Nothing compares."

I want you to think about a time your gut was right. When the numbers said one thing, but you knew better. Maybe at work. Maybe in a relationship. Maybe just a feeling you couldn't explain.

That instinct? It wasn't a fluke. It was your lived experience doing what nothing else can do.

Trust it.

---

**[7:00-9:30] Grounding Word 3 — Permission**

Number three. This one's for anyone who's been carrying the weight of keeping up.

"I give myself permission to navigate this moment with curiosity, not panic."

Say it:

"I give myself permission to navigate this moment with curiosity, not panic."

You don't need a five-year plan. You don't need to know everything. You just need to stay curious. That's the whole strategy.

Let that pressure go for a second. Just be here.

---

**[9:30-12:00] Grounding Word 4 — Strength**

Grounding word four. For anyone who's ever wondered if they're falling behind.

"I can learn any tool. No tool can learn to be me."

Say it with me:

"I can learn any tool. No tool can learn to be me."

Tools change every six months. You adapt every time. That pattern is your proof. You've never stayed stuck. You've always found the next step.

And this time is no different.

---

**[12:00-14:30] Grounding Word 5 — Hope**

Last one. Take a breath first.

"The future belongs to people who know who they are. I am becoming that person."

One more time:

"The future belongs to people who know who they are. I am becoming that person."

Not the fastest person. Not the most connected. The one who knows who they are. That's who you're becoming. Right now. In this moment.

---

**[14:30-17:00] Closing / Engagement**

Take one more breath with me.

In... and out.

Thank you for being here. Seriously. It takes something to stop scrolling and actually sit with these words.

If one of these grounding words hit different — drop it in the chat. I want to know which one you're carrying into the week.

And if you want a full practice — we have a free 5-day grounding guide. Link is in our bio. It has affirmations, breathwork, and reflection prompts for each day. Print it out, keep your favorite grounding word where you'll see it.

We'll do this again. Same time, same place. Follow @luminouspulse.co so you don't miss the next one.

You are held. Don't forget it.

See you soon.

### IG Live 2: "Q&A — Your Anxiety Is Valid"
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Best for**: Week 5 or 6
**Promote**: Q&A box in Stories 2 days before ("What keeps you up at night about the future?")

---

**[0:00-2:00] Opening**

Hey, welcome back. Today's a little different — I collected your questions from Stories about layoffs, career uncertainty, and all the feelings that come with watching your industry reshape itself in real time.

Quick ground rule: there are no dumb questions here. If you're feeling it, someone else is too. That's why we're doing this.

Let's get into it.

---

**[2:00-5:00] Q1: "Will the world I planned for still exist?"**

This is the big one, right? Here's my honest answer.

The world is changing. The future you planned for might look different than you expected. That's already happening.

But the parts of you that matter most? Those are about to matter more than ever. Your judgment. Your empathy. Your ability to read a room. Your capacity to build trust. Those are human gifts, and they're not going anywhere.

Your life is evolving. You are evolving with it. That's different from being erased.

Grounding word for this: "I was built for uncertainty. I have navigated it my entire life."

---

**[5:00-8:00] Q2: "How do I stop doomscrolling?"**

I struggle with this too. Here's what works for me:

One — set a time limit. Fifteen minutes of news in the morning. That's it.

Two — for every scary headline you read, find one story of someone building something hopeful. Balance the input.

Three — remember that headlines are optimized for clicks, not truth. Your life is more nuanced than any headline.

And four — when you notice the tightness in your chest, that's your body telling you to put the phone down. Listen to it.

Grounding word: "The headlines are designed to scare me. My life is designed to be lived."

---

**[8:00-11:00] Q3: "I feel like I'm not adapting fast enough"**

Here's the thing: you don't have to keep up with everything. Nobody can.

The pressure to learn every tool, read every announcement, have an opinion on everything — that's not growth. That's anxiety wearing a productivity mask.

The people who actually navigate change well? They're not the ones consuming the most. They're the ones who stay grounded in who they are while the ground shifts.

That's the real adaptation. Knowing yourself well enough that change doesn't shake your foundation.

Grounding word: "I am allowed to move at my own pace. Healing is not a race. Growth is not a race."

---

**[11:00-14:00] Q4: "Is it naive to feel hopeful?"**

No. Absolutely not.

Hope is not naivete. Hope is the radical choice to keep showing up when every headline gives you a reason not to.

Being hopeful doesn't mean pretending everything is fine. It means believing that you and the people around you are capable of building something worth showing up for.

That takes more courage than cynicism ever will.

Grounding word: "Hope is not naivete. Hope is the radical choice to keep showing up."

---

**[14:00-17:00] Closing**

Last thing. I want everyone to take one grounding word from today and keep it somewhere you'll see it this week.

Write it on a sticky note. Set it as your phone wallpaper. Say it in the mirror before your first meeting.

The feeling follows the words. Not the other way around.

If you want a full practice — free 5-day grounding guide in our bio.

Thank you for showing up. You are held. Drop your takeaway in the chat. See you next time.
