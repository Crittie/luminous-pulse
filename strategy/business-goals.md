## part 1: how many sams are out there?

### the raw numbers

| data point | number | source |
|------------|--------|--------|
| annual job cuts announced (2025) | 1,206,374 | Challenger, Gray & Christmas |
| annual job cuts announced (2024) | 761,358 | Challenger, Gray & Christmas |
| long-tenured displaced workers (3+ years at company) | 2.6M | BLS Displaced Workers Survey 2024 |
| reemployed after displacement | 65.7% | BLS |
| **still displaced / underemployed** | **~892,000** | BLS (34.3% not reemployed) |
| tech-specific layoffs (2025) | 122,549 | layoffs.fyi |
| tech-specific layoffs (2024) | 152,922 | layoffs.fyi |
| tech-specific layoffs (2023) | ~265,000 | layoffs.fyi |
| **total layoffs & discharges per year (all industries)** | **~20.8M** | BLS JOLTS 2025 |
| US workers who tie identity to their job | 55% | APA / Gallup |
| college graduates who derive identity from work | 70% | Gallup |
| unemployed people experiencing anxiety/depression | 56% | Cambridge / PMC research |
| laid-off individuals 2x more likely to have clinical anxiety | 2x | University of Cambridge |
| **don't speak about mental health after layoff** | **60%** | Mind Share Partners |
| long-term unemployed (27+ weeks) as of Aug 2025 | 1.9M | BLS (highest since COVID) |
| average unemployment duration | 23.4 weeks (~5.5 months) | BLS Q4 2024 |
| life satisfaction after job loss | does not fully recover | Lucas et al. (15-year study, N=24,000) |
| journals & planners market (2025) | $1.12B | market research |

### what this means for us

the crisis isn't just unemployment. it's **identity loss + silent suffering**.

- 892,000 people are still displaced right now (BLS)
- 55% of all workers (70% of college grads) tie identity to their job — so most of those 892K are in some form of identity crisis
- 60% never talk about it — these are sam. invisible, ashamed, suffering quietly
- average unemployment lasts 23 weeks — that's 5.5 months of carrying this alone
- and every month, ~100K new people join them (2025 pace: 1.2M/year ÷ 12)
- even after reemployment, research shows life satisfaction does NOT fully recover — the identity wound persists

**the market is not shrinking.** 2025 had 58% more layoffs than 2024. the layoff cycle is accelerating, not slowing.

### how many people are sam? (bottoms-up estimate)

sam's profile: mid-career, age 30-44, earning $85K-$140K before layoff.

| step | calculation | result |
|------|-------------|--------|
| US civilian labor force age 30-44 | BLS data | ~50-52M workers |
| earning $85K-$140K (55th-85th percentile for age) | ~20-25% of that group | ~10-13M workers |
| annual layoff rate for professional/knowledge workers | ~3-5% (Challenger-based) | **~450,000-500,000 Sams laid off per year** |
| displaced at any given moment (avg 5-month duration) | ~40% of annual flow | **~200,000 Sams right now** |
| expanded (ages 28-45, $70K-$160K, includes underemployed) | 1.5x-3x | **~1.5-2M/year who would resonate** |

**~200,000 people matching Sam's exact profile are displaced right now. ~500K new ones every year. and the number is growing.**

### TAM / SAM / SOM

#### TAM — total addressable market
*everyone who could theoretically buy a grounding workbook for career displacement*

| segment | size | reasoning |
|---------|------|-----------|
| currently displaced workers (US) | ~892,000 | BLS: 2.6M long-tenured displaced × 34.3% not reemployed |
| recently displaced (past 12 months) | ~1,200,000 | Challenger 2025: 1.2M job cuts announced |
| underemployed / identity-in-crisis | ~500,000 | people who found *a* job but lost *their* job — still grieving the identity |
| partners / family members affected | ~1,000,000 | conservative 1:1 ratio of affected household members |
| **TAM** | **~3,600,000** | people in the US who are in or adjacent to the displaced worker identity crisis right now |

at an average order value of $18 (weighted across $9-$47 product range):

**TAM revenue = ~$64.8M/year** (if every possible customer bought one product)

this is theoretical. we'll never reach all of them. but it shows the market exists.

---

#### SAM — serviceable addressable market
*the segment we can actually reach through instagram + email*

| filter | percentage | remaining |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| TAM (starting) | 100% | 3,600,000 |
| age 28-45 (our demo) | ~45% | 1,620,000 |
| uses instagram | ~55% | 891,000 |
| follows wellness / mental health content | ~30% | 267,300 |
| english-speaking (US, UK, Canada, Australia) | ~85% | 227,200 |
| **SAM** | | **~227,000 reachable sams** |

at $18 average order: **SAM revenue = ~$4.1M/year**

this is the pool of people who match sam's profile, are on instagram, and consume the kind of content where they could realistically discover us.

---

#### SOM — serviceable obtainable market
*what we can realistically capture in year 1 with our budget and resources*

| metric | conservative | moderate | stretch |
|--------|-------------|----------|---------|
| email subscribers (year 1) | 1,500 | 3,000 | 5,000 |
| purchase conversion rate | 5% | 8% | 12% |
| customers (year 1) | 75 | 240 | 600 |
| average order value | $15 | $18 | $22 |
| repeat purchase rate | 30% | 40% | 50% |
| **year 1 revenue** | **$1,463** | **$6,048** | **$19,800** |

the key lever is the **purchase conversion rate**. that's where the quiz funnel changes everything.

---

## part 2: the quiz funnel — why it's perfect for sam

### the data

| metric | standard PDF lead magnet | quiz funnel | improvement |
|--------|------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| email opt-in rate | 18% | 40.1% | **+123%** |
| IG-specific conversion | ~15% | 40.8% | **+172%** |
| email revenue per recipient (segmented vs not) | $0.06 | $0.19 | **+217%** |
| email open rates | baseline | +14.31% higher | significant |
| email click-through rates | baseline | 2x higher | **+101%** |
| product recommendation → purchase | 2% baseline | 5% | **+150%** |

sources: Interact 2026 Conversion Rate Report, Mailmodo segmentation data, Ignite Visibility product quiz study.

### why sam responds to a quiz (not a PDF)

1. **it's private.** sam takes it alone on the couch at 2am. nobody watches. nobody knows.

2. **it gives sam a framework.** sam is drowning in unnamed feelings. a self-assessment that says "you're experiencing [this]" gives sam the vocabulary they've been missing. that naming is the value — before any product recommendation.

3. **it tells sam which workbook to buy.** sam doesn't want to browse 8 products. sam wants to be told: "based on where you are, start here." the quiz is the prescription model automated.

4. **it converts 2x better than a PDF.** 40% of quiz starters give their email vs 18% for a static lead magnet. that's the single highest-leverage change we can make to the funnel.

5. **it segments automatically.** different quiz outcomes → different Kit tags → different email sequences → different product recommendations. segmented emails generate 3x more revenue per recipient.

### why "quiz" is the wrong word for sam

**never call it a quiz.** sam associates "quiz" with judgment, right/wrong answers, being tested.

call it:
- "self-assessment"
- "personal grounding inventory"
- "find your grounding practice" (recommended — matches the product language)

---

## part 3: the quiz design — "find your grounding practice"

### the concept

**name**: "find your grounding practice"
**subtitle**: "a 2-minute self-assessment to find the right starting point for where you are right now."
**questions**: 6
**time**: ~2 minutes
**platform**: Interact ($27/month annual — Lite plan, 500 leads/month, native Kit integration)

### the 6 questions

**question 1 (easy warm-up — build momentum)**

> how long has it been since the shift happened?

- less than 2 weeks
- 2-6 weeks
- 2-6 months
- more than 6 months
- it hasn't happened yet — I'm bracing for it

*why first: non-threatening. factual. no emotional exposure yet. builds momentum for harder questions.*

---

**question 2 (still safe — behavioral)**

> when you're scrolling at night, what are you usually looking for?

- something to calm the noise in my head
- someone who actually gets what this feels like
- a plan — something to do with all this energy
- honestly? I'm just trying to get through the night
- I don't even know what I'm looking for

*why second: behavioral, not emotional. still feels safe. reveals whether sam needs grounding (calm), naming (seen), or structure (plan).*

---

**question 3 (the naming question — this is where the connection happens)**

> which of these sounds most like the thing you carry but don't talk about?

- "I don't know who I am without that role."
- "I'm grieving and I feel stupid about it."
- "I keep saying I'm fine. I'm not fine."
- "I'm terrified of what comes next."
- "I'm angry and I don't know where to put it."

*why third: this is the critical question. it names what sam can't articulate. the framing — "the thing you carry but don't talk about" — normalizes the silence before asking sam to break it. research says sensitive questions placed after question 3 cause the least drop-off.*

---

**question 4 (practical — what does sam need right now)**

> what would actually help you today?

- something to calm my body when the spiral starts
- a space to write what I can't say out loud
- permission to slow down and stop performing
- help rebuilding my sense of who I am underneath the title
- all of the above, honestly

*why fourth: solution-oriented. sam is now ready to think about what they need — the first 3 questions built the emotional trust.*

---

**question 5 (format preference — practical)**

> when you imagine doing something for yourself, what sounds most realistic?

- 2 minutes in the morning with a pen and paper
- a longer sit-down practice when the house is quiet
- something I can do right before a hard moment (interview, phone call)
- a 30-day structured practice with daily prompts
- I honestly don't know — just tell me what to do

*why fifth: practical. helps recommend the right product format. also: the last option ("just tell me what to do") is sam's actual preference — and it maps directly to the prescription model.*

---

**question 6 (the bridge — moves toward the recommendation)**

> last one. what matters most in a grounding practice for you?

- it's private — no app, no account, no one knows
- it's evidence-based — not woo-woo
- it's short — I don't have the bandwidth for anything heavy
- it actually names what I'm feeling, not just positive affirmations
- it tells me where to start — I'm too exhausted to figure it out

*why last: every option maps to a selling point of the workbooks. "private" → printable. "evidence-based" → neuroscience framing. "short" → 2-minute daily format. "names the feeling" → our core differentiator. "tells me where to start" → the prescription model.*

### the 4 outcomes

each outcome maps to a Kit tag, an email sequence, and a product recommendation.

#### outcome 1: "the tender one"
**tag**: `quiz-tender`
**mapped to**: "tender landings" ($12)

> you're in the raw part. the grief is still fresh, and nobody around you seems to understand the weight of it. that's not weakness — that's honesty.

> your starting point: "tender landings" — 44 pages for naming what nobody talks about. unsent letters, grief timelines, permission slips, and a space to feel what you're actually feeling.

> **recommended**: tender landings ($12) — [link]
> **or start free**: 5-day grounding practice — [link]

#### outcome 2: "the unnamed one"
**tag**: `quiz-identity`
**mapped to**: "who am I without the title?" ($15)

> the job is gone, but the identity crisis stayed. you keep asking yourself who you are without the role, and nobody around you knows that's the real question.

> your starting point: "who am I without the title?" — 49 pages of excavation. not career planning — identity work. the version of you that exists underneath the title.

> **recommended**: who am I without the title? ($15) — [link]
> **or start free**: 5-day grounding practice — [link]

#### outcome 3: "the bracing one"
**tag**: `quiz-grounding`
**mapped to**: "before the room" ($9) or "30 days of ground" ($17)

> you need something immediate. a way to lower the temperature when the spiral starts. a tool for the 30 minutes before the interview, the phone call, the hard conversation.

> your starting point: "before the room" ($9) — a timed grounding ritual for the moment everything feels like too much.

> **recommended**: before the room ($9) — [link]
> **want the daily practice?** 30 days of ground ($17) — one page, one prompt, one breath, every day for a month. — [link]
> **or start free**: 5-day grounding practice — [link]

#### outcome 4: "the rebuilder"
**tag**: `quiz-rebuild`
**mapped to**: "steady" ($15) or "the complete grounding collection" ($47)

> you've been in this for a while. the acute grief has softened, but the rebuilding feels endless. you need structure. something that meets you where you are and walks with you.

> your starting point: "steady" ($15) — a 12-week guided reflection practice. slow, structured, built for the long middle.

> **recommended**: steady ($15) — [link]
> **want everything?** the complete grounding collection ($47) — all 8 workbooks, 404 pages, every stage of the journey. — [link]
> **or start free**: 5-day grounding practice — [link]

### quiz → Kit integration

```
quiz outcome          →  Kit tag          →  email sequence        →  product pitch
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"the tender one"      →  quiz-tender      →  grief-focused nurture →  tender landings ($12)
"the unnamed one"     →  quiz-identity    →  identity-focused      →  who am I ($15)
"the bracing one"     →  quiz-grounding   →  grounding-focused     →  before the room ($9)
"the rebuilder"       →  quiz-rebuild     →  rebuild-focused       →  steady ($15) / bundle ($47)
```

each sequence:
- email 1 (day 0): quiz results + free 5-day practice PDF (everyone gets the lead magnet regardless)
- email 2 (day 3): deeper content matching their outcome type
- email 3 (day 7): prescription — "based on your results, this is where I'd start" + product link
- email 4 (day 12): social proof / workbook page preview specific to their outcome
- email 5 (day 17): soft close + bundle option

### quiz funnel metrics to track

| metric | target | action if below target |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| quiz start rate (from IG) | 30-40% of link clicks | improve quiz landing page copy |
| quiz completion rate | 70-80% | reduce questions or simplify wording |
| email opt-in rate (post-quiz) | 40%+ of completions | adjust results page — show partial results before email gate |
| quiz → purchase (within 21 days) | 8-12% | optimize prescription email sequence |
| quiz → purchase (within 60 days) | 15-20% | add retargeting ads for non-converters |

---

## part 4: updated revenue projections

### scenario A: without quiz funnel (PDF lead magnet only)

| metric | month 1 | month 3 | month 6 | month 12 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| ad spend | $150 | $300 | $600 | $600 |
| IG bio clicks | 150 | 500 | 1,200 | 2,000 |
| email signups (18% conversion) | 27 | 90 | 216 | 360 |
| cumulative email list | 27 | 207 | 855 | 2,475 |
| purchase rate (unsegmented) | 5% | 6% | 7% | 8% |
| monthly purchases | 1 | 5 | 15 | 29 |
| avg order value | $15 | $16 | $17 | $18 |
| **monthly revenue** | **$15** | **$80** | **$255** | **$522** |
| **cumulative revenue** | **$15** | **$175** | **$1,020** | **$4,236** |
| cumulative ad spend | $150 | $750 | $2,250 | $5,850 |
| **net (revenue - ads)** | **-$135** | **-$575** | **-$1,230** | **-$1,614** |

**without the quiz, we're underwater for the entire first year.** the low conversion rate of a PDF lead magnet + unsegmented email list means we can't profitably acquire customers at this ad budget.

---

### scenario B: with quiz funnel

| metric | month 1 | month 3 | month 6 | month 12 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| ad spend | $150 | $300 | $600 | $600 |
| IG bio clicks | 150 | 500 | 1,200 | 2,000 |
| quiz starts (70% of clicks) | 105 | 350 | 840 | 1,400 |
| quiz completions (75%) | 79 | 263 | 630 | 1,050 |
| email signups (40% of completions) | 32 | 105 | 252 | 420 |
| cumulative email list | 32 | 242 | 1,002 | 2,898 |
| purchase rate (segmented) | 8% | 10% | 12% | 12% |
| monthly purchases | 3 | 11 | 30 | 50 |
| avg order value | $16 | $18 | $20 | $22 |
| **monthly revenue** | **$48** | **$198** | **$600** | **$1,100** |
| **cumulative revenue** | **$48** | **$444** | **$2,484** | **$10,644** |
| cumulative ad spend | $177 | $831 | $2,631 | $6,231 |
| **net (revenue - ads)** | **-$129** | **-$387** | **-$147** | **+$4,413** |

note: ad spend includes $27/month for Interact.

**with the quiz, we break even around month 5-6 and are profitable by month 8-9.** the combination of higher conversion rate (40% vs 18%), segmented email sequences (3x revenue per recipient), and prescription selling (higher AOV) compounds over time.

---

### scenario C: with quiz funnel + organic growth compounding

organic IG growth kicks in around month 3-4 as the algorithm starts surfacing our content to new audiences (save rate is the key signal). this adds free traffic on top of paid.

| metric | month 1 | month 3 | month 6 | month 12 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| paid bio clicks | 150 | 500 | 1,200 | 2,000 |
| organic bio clicks | 20 | 150 | 600 | 1,500 |
| **total bio clicks** | **170** | **650** | **1,800** | **3,500** |
| quiz email signups | 36 | 137 | 378 | 735 |
| cumulative email list | 36 | 309 | 1,485 | 5,103 |
| monthly purchases | 3 | 14 | 45 | 88 |
| avg order value | $16 | $18 | $20 | $22 |
| **monthly revenue** | **$48** | **$252** | **$900** | **$1,936** |
| **cumulative revenue** | **$48** | **$552** | **$3,552** | **$16,032** |
| cumulative ad spend + Interact | $177 | $831 | $2,631 | $6,231 |
| **net** | **-$129** | **-$279** | **+$921** | **+$9,801** |

**with organic compounding, we break even around month 4-5 and clear ~$10K profit in year 1.**

---

### the year 1 summary

| scenario | year 1 revenue | year 1 ad spend | year 1 profit | email list size |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| A: PDF only | $4,236 | $5,850 | **-$1,614** | 2,475 |
| B: quiz funnel | $10,644 | $6,231 | **+$4,413** | 2,898 |
| C: quiz + organic | $16,032 | $6,231 | **+$9,801** | 5,103 |

**the quiz funnel is not optional. it's the difference between losing money and building a sustainable business.**

---

## part 5: implementation plan

### phase 1: quiz build (week 1)

| task | who | tool | cost |
|------|-----|------|------|
| sign up for Interact (14-day free trial) | Christie | tryinteract.com | $0 (trial) |

| create 4 outcome-specific email sequences in Kit | Claude Code writes copy, Christie builds in Kit | Kit | — |
| test full flow: IG link → quiz → email → product link | both | — | — |

### phase 2: quiz launch (week 2)

| task | who |
|------|-----|

| update IG bio: "take the free self-assessment →" or "find your grounding practice →" | Christie |
| update website: add quiz CTA alongside current email form | both |
| first IG story promoting quiz: "I made something for 2am" | Christie |
| first organic reel with quiz CTA: "which one sounds like you?" | Christie |

### phase 3: ads (week 3-4)

| task | who |
|------|-----|
| create cold ad: permission hook carousel → quiz landing page | both |
| create retargeting ad: prescription carousel → product page | both |
| set up Meta Pixel on quiz and product pages | Christie |

| monitor CPL (cost per lead) and quiz completion rate daily | Christie |

### phase 4: optimize (month 2+)

| signal | action |
|--------|--------|
| quiz completion < 70% | simplify questions 4-6, add progress bar |
| email opt-in < 35% | show partial results before email gate |
| quiz → purchase < 5% | rewrite prescription emails, add workbook preview images |
| one outcome gets 60%+ of results | quiz questions aren't differentiating — revise question 3 |
| one product outsells others 3:1 | lean into it — feature in ads, boost in email |

---

## part 6: costs and break-even

### monthly operating costs

| item | monthly cost | notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Instagram ads | $150-$600 | scales over time |
| Interact (quiz) | $27 | annual plan, Lite tier, 500 leads/month |
| Kit | $0 | free tier up to 10K subscribers |
| ManyChat | $0 | free tier |
| Metricool | $0 | free tier |
| Beacons | $0 | free tier |
| Canva | $0-$13 | free or Pro |
| domain (luminouspulse.co) | ~$1 | already paid annually |
| Vercel hosting | $0 | free tier |
| **total** | **$178-$641** | |

### break-even calculation

at $178/month minimum operating costs:

| avg order value | purchases needed to break even | with 10% conversion rate, email list needed |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| $15 | 12/month | 120 subscribers |
| $18 | 10/month | 100 subscribers |
| $22 | 9/month | 90 subscribers |

**at 100 active email subscribers with segmented quiz data, we break even.**
that's reachable in month 2-3 with the quiz funnel.

at $641/month full operating costs:

| avg order value | purchases needed | email list needed (10% conversion) |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| $15 | 43/month | 430 subscribers |
| $18 | 36/month | 360 subscribers |
| $22 | 30/month | 300 subscribers |

**at 300-400 subscribers, we break even at full ad spend.** that's month 4-5.

---

## part 7: the bigger picture

### adjacent markets (year 2+)

the grounding workbook line is the entry point. as the brand grows and we understand our audience better, adjacent opportunities include:

| opportunity | price range | timing |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| guided audio packs (body scans, breathwork, NSDR) | $15-$27 | month 6+ |
| seasonal practice bundles (moon cycles, solstice) | $12-$19 | month 9+ |
| group grounding sessions (paid IG Lives or Zoom) | $15-$25/session | month 6+ |
| "the sanctuary" membership (weekly practices + community) | $9-$15/month | year 2 |
| corporate workshop (grounding for teams going through layoffs) | $500-$2,000/session | year 2 |
| licensing to outplacement firms | $5,000-$20,000/year | year 2-3 |

the outplacement market is $5B+ and growing (projected $7.4-$9.2B by 2030-2033, CAGR 7.2%). the career coaching market is $1.43B. the personal development market is $51.6B. the journals & planners market alone is $1.12B and growing at 4.1%/year — with 54% of planners now including wellness pages.

corporate grounding workshops for displaced teams is a legitimate B2B play once we have testimonials and a track record.

### the whitespace

career coaching addresses skills and job search. therapy addresses clinical conditions. but the "who am I without my job title?" question — experienced by 55-70% of displaced professionals — has **no mainstream product addressing it**.

that's us. we sit in the gap between tactical career help and clinical therapy. grounding for people who won't call it therapy and don't need career advice. the emotional work that makes everything else possible.

### why this market is defensible

1. **the need is accelerating.** 1.2M job cuts in 2025 (58% increase over 2024). 1.9M long-term unemployed. this is not a trend. it's a structural shift.
2. **nobody is doing this.** career coaches are tactical. therapists are clinical. nobody occupies the space between — emotional grounding for silent sufferers at 2am.
3. **the pain persists even after reemployment.** research shows life satisfaction does not fully recover after job loss — even years later. the identity wound outlasts the unemployment. this means our TAM includes people who found new jobs but are still carrying it.
4. **our audience grows itself.** sam DMs one friend a screenshot. that friend becomes a subscriber. the growth model is private, trust-based, and impossible for competitors to replicate with ads alone.
5. **the quiz builds a moat.** every quiz response is zero-party data. we learn what displaced workers are actually feeling, in their own words, at scale. that data makes every product, email, and ad better over time.

## part 8: 12-month milestones

| milestone | target | when |
