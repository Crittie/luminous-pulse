## Safety Notes

- When posting about healing techniques, always include: "This is educational, not medical advice"
- Reference evidence level (clinical vs. traditional) — see `healing-practices-reference-guide.md`
- For advanced practices (EMDR, holotropic breathwork), always recommend professional guidance
- Never link in X/Twitter posts (kills reach by 50-80%). Bio link only.
- Never use "tag a friend" or "comment below" on any platform. Sam engages privately.
- Lowercase for all brand copy. Only exceptions: "I" and proper nouns.
