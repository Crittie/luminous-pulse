# business plan — luminous pulse: the path to $1M

> updated business plan incorporating value ladder, recurring revenue, B2B corporate strategy, and multi-platform distribution.
> builds on `business-goals.md` (quiz funnel, market sizing) — this document adds the structural changes needed to reach $1M.
> all projections based on research from three independent analyses. see sources at bottom.

---

## executive summary

luminous pulse currently projects $10K-$16K in year 1 revenue selling $9-$47 printable workbooks through instagram. **that model has a structural ceiling.** at $18 average order value, $1M requires 55,556 purchases/year — impossible at current scale.

this plan transforms the business from a low-ticket PDF shop into a **multi-tier wellness brand with recurring revenue and B2B corporate sales**. the core insight: the workbooks are the trust-builder, not the business model. the real revenue comes from higher-ticket products, membership, and corporate licensing.

**the revised targets:**

| timeline | revenue | profit | what changes |
|----------|---------|--------|--------------|
| year 1 | $85K-$120K | $65K-$95K | add course + membership + etsy/pinterest + first B2B clients |
| year 2 | $300K-$500K | $200K-$350K | scale ads, 10-20 corporate clients, 500+ members |
| year 3 | $800K-$1.2M | $600K-$900K | full product ladder, B2B channel established, small team |

**the brand positioning doesn't change.** the sanctuary for displaced workers. the quiet voice at 2am. the emotional work that makes everything else possible. that's the moat. what changes is the business architecture around it.

## part 1: why the current model caps out

### the math problem

| price point | units needed for $1M | monthly units | realistic? |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------|------------|
| $18 avg (current) | 55,556 | 4,630 | no — requires 250K+ email subscribers |
| $47 (complete collection) | 21,277 | 1,773 | no — still too many units for niche |
| $197 (course) | 5,076 | 423 | hard but possible with proven funnel |
| $47/month membership (500 members) | — | steady state | yes — recurring revenue compounds |
| hybrid model | mixed | see below | **yes — this is the path** |

### what's missing

1. **no recurring revenue.** every month starts at $0. the most successful wellness businesses (Calm, Headspace, The Bloom Method, Silk + Sonder) all run on subscription models.
2. **no mid-to-high ticket offer.** PDFs cap at ~$47. courses sell for $197-$997. group coaching sells for $997-$2,000. corporate workshops sell for $1,500-$5,000. one corporate deal = 556 individual PDF sales.
3. **single-channel distribution.** instagram organic reach dropped 28% year-over-year. pinterest, etsy, linkedin, youtube, and SEO are untapped.
4. **no B2B revenue.** the outplacement market is $5.65B and growing 7.6%/year. employers spend $742/employee/year on wellness and $1,900/employee on outplacement. luminous pulse addresses the emotional gap neither career coaches nor therapists fill — and companies will pay for that.

## part 2: the value ladder

the workbooks stay. they become the base of a six-tier product architecture.

### tier 1: free (lead generation)

| product | price | purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| "find your grounding practice" quiz | $0 | email capture, segmentation, trust |
| 5-day grounding practice PDF | $0 | delivered post-quiz via Kit |
| grounding words (IG/Pinterest content) | $0 | audience building, brand awareness |

### tier 2: entry ($9-$47) — current products

| product | price | role in ladder |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| "before the room" | $9 | impulse buy, first transaction |
| "tender landings" | $12 | grief-specific, quiz-recommended |
| "who am I without the title?" | $15 | identity-specific, quiz-recommended |
| "steady" | $15 | long-form practice |
| "30 days of ground" | $17 | daily practice |
| "the in-between" | $27 | flagship workbook |
| "the recovery starter" bundle | $27 | starter bundle |
| "the complete grounding collection" | $47 | full library |

### tier 3: mid-ticket ($97-$297) — NEW

**"grounded through change" — a 6-week online course**

- 6 video modules (pre-recorded, self-paced)
- companion workbook (digital, designed to match course modules)
- private community access (circle or mighty networks) for duration of course
- weekly group Q&A call (live, recorded for replay)
- includes all tier 2 workbooks as bonus
- **price: $197** (launch price $147 for first cohort)

course outline:
1. week 1: what's actually happening to you (nervous system education)
2. week 2: naming the grief nobody talks about (identity loss)
3. week 3: the 2am toolkit (regulation techniques)
4. week 4: who are you without the title? (identity excavation)
5. week 5: the daily practice (building sustainable grounding habits)
6. week 6: the slow rebuild (moving forward without rushing)

**why this works for sam:** sam won't call it therapy. sam won't hire a coach. but sam will take a self-paced course that feels private, evidence-based, and structured. the course format gives sam what the workbooks can't — video guidance, community proof that others feel this way, and a weekly touchpoint.

**build time:** 6-8 weeks. **investment:** $500-$5,000 (filming + course platform).

### tier 4: recurring ($39/month) — NEW

**"the sanctuary" — monthly membership**

- new themed grounding workbook each month (digital)
- weekly live grounding session (zoom, 30 min, recorded)
- private community (always-on, moderated)
- archive access to all existing workbooks
- monthly expert guest session (therapists, somatic practitioners, career counselors)
- early access to new products
- **price: $39/month** ($29/month annual plan)

**the math:** 500 active members × $39/month = $19,500/month = **$234,000/year**

at 5% monthly churn, need ~25 new members/month to maintain 500. at $30-$50 CPA, acquisition cost = $750-$1,250/month. with 10-month average lifespan, LTV = $390. **LTV:CAC ratio = 8:1-13:1** (excellent).

**build time:** 2-3 weeks to set up platform + first month of content. **investment:** $49-$100/month (Circle or Mighty Networks).

### tier 5: high-ticket ($997-$3,000) — NEW

**"rebuild" — 12-week group coaching cohort**

- 8-12 people per cohort
- weekly 90-minute group session (zoom)
- 1:1 check-in call at start and end
- all course + workbook materials included
- private cohort community channel
- **price: $997** (or $1,497 with 2 additional 1:1 sessions)
- **frequency: 4 cohorts/year** (one per quarter)

**the math:** 10 people × $997 × 4 cohorts = **$39,880/year** (or $59,880 at $1,497)

**1:1 coaching (limited availability)**

- 6-session package over 12 weeks
- **price: $3,000**
- **cap: 20 clients/year** (to prevent burnout)
- **revenue: $60,000/year**

### tier 6: B2B corporate ($1,500-$25,000) — NEW

## part 3: the $1M revenue model

### product mix at $1M (year 3 target)

| revenue stream | unit price | units/year | annual revenue | % of total |
|----------------|-----------|------------|----------------|------------|
| low-ticket workbooks ($9-$47) | $18 avg | 5,000 | $90,000 | 9% |
| digital course ($197) | $197 | 800 | $157,600 | 16% |
| membership ($39/mo) | $468/yr avg | 600 active | $280,800 | 28% |
| group coaching ($997) | $997 | 40 | $39,880 | 4% |
| 1:1 coaching ($3,000) | $3,000 | 20 | $60,000 | 6% |
| corporate workshops | $1,500 | 80 | $120,000 | 12% |
| corporate packages (4-session) | $5,000 | 20 | $100,000 | 10% |
| outplacement licensing | $12,000/yr | 8 | $96,000 | 10% |
| speaking + affiliate | varies | — | $50,000 | 5% |
| **total** | | | **$994,280** | **100%** |

### the B2C / B2B split

| segment | revenue | percentage |
|---------|---------|------------|
| B2C (individuals) | $628,280 | 63% |
| B2B (corporate + licensing) | $316,000 | 32% |
| other (speaking, affiliate) | $50,000 | 5% |

**B2B represents ~32% of revenue but requires far fewer transactions.** 8 licensing deals + 100 corporate workshops = $316K. achieving the same revenue from workbooks alone would require 17,556 individual sales.

---

## part 4: B2B corporate strategy

### the opportunity

the outplacement market is **$5.65 billion** (2025) and growing at 7.6% CAGR. but traditional outplacement is tactical — resume writing, job boards, interview prep. **nobody addresses the emotional/identity crisis.** that's the whitespace luminous pulse fills.

| data point | number | source |
|------------|--------|--------|
| outplacement market (2025) | $5.65B | Verified Market Reports |
| projected market (2030) | $8.17B | 7.63% CAGR |
| employer spend per employee (outplacement) | $1,900 avg | Careerminds |
| employer spend per employee (wellness) | $742/yr avg | WellSteps |
| DOGE federal workforce cuts (2025) | 350,000+ | OPM / Wikipedia |
| net federal reduction | 242,000 (10%+ of workforce) | OPM |
| total US layoffs 2025 (all industries) | 20.8M | BLS JOLTS |
| companies planning to increase wellness spend | 74% | CEO Today |

### the product: "workforce transition resilience program"

package the existing workbooks + new course materials into a corporate offering:

**single workshop ($1,500)**
- 90-minute virtual workshop for displaced teams
- facilitator-led grounding session (physiological sigh, naming exercise, permission practice)
- each participant receives digital workbook bundle
- post-session resource guide
- ideal for: teams of 10-50 going through layoffs

**workshop package ($5,000)**
- 4 sessions over 4-6 weeks
- session 1: "what's actually happening to your nervous system" (regulation)
- session 2: "naming the grief nobody talks about" (identity + grief)
- session 3: "grounding for the job search" (practical tools)
- session 4: "the slow rebuild" (forward movement)
- each participant receives complete grounding collection
- post-program check-in survey
- ideal for: companies conducting layoffs who want to support departing employees

**annual license ($12,000/year)**
- unlimited digital workbook access for all displaced employees
- quarterly facilitator-led workshops (4/year)
- custom-branded grounding resources (co-branded PDF covers)
- HR dashboard with anonymized usage data
- ideal for: outplacement firms, large employers, EAP providers

### B2B pricing rationale

luminous pulse corporate pricing is **5-10x cheaper than traditional outplacement** while addressing the emotional component that traditional services ignore.

| service | traditional outplacement | luminous pulse |
|---------|------------------------|----------------|
| per-employee cost | $500-$1,900 | $30-$50 |
| what's included | resume, job boards, interview prep | grounding, identity work, grief processing, daily practice |
| delivery | 1:1 coaching (expensive to scale) | digital + group (scales infinitely) |
| emotional component | minimal | core focus |
| positioning | "get your next job" | "get back to yourself first" |

**this isn't a replacement for outplacement — it's a complement.** companies can offer both: traditional career services + luminous pulse for the emotional work.

### B2B sales strategy

**target buyers:**
1. HR directors at companies announcing layoffs (public information — monitor Challenger reports, layoffs.fyi)
2. outplacement firm partners (approach as a complementary offering)
3. EAP (Employee Assistance Program) providers
4. workforce development agencies
5. career coaching practices (white-label or referral partnership)

**outreach channels:**
- LinkedIn content + direct outreach (Christie's PMP credential is a trust signal for HR)
- cold email to HR directors at companies that announced layoffs in the past 30 days
- partnership outreach to outplacement firms (pitch as addon to existing services)
- conference speaking (HR, wellness, career transition events)

**timeline:**
- month 4-5: build B2B one-pager + case study template
- month 6: first 3 free workshops (for testimonials and case studies)
- month 7-8: first paid workshops
- month 9-10: first licensing conversations
- month 11-12: first licensing deal signed

## part 5: multi-platform channel strategy

instagram alone caps reach at ~227,000 reachable sams. the plan needs more channels.

### channel priorities (updated with paid ad benchmarks — feb 2026)

| channel | role | paid ad CPC | monthly budget | when to start |
|---------|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| **instagram/meta** | primary paid channel + community | $0.40-$1.73 | $150-$300 (month 1) | now (active) |
| **pinterest** | evergreen discovery + cheapest paid | $0.10-$1.50 | $50-$150 (month 1) | now |
| **etsy** | marketplace for printable workbooks | n/a (marketplace) | $0 (organic) | month 1-2 |
| **SEO/blog** | captures search intent (free traffic) | n/a ($5+ CPC — too expensive for paid) | $0 (organic) | month 1 (publish existing) |
| **tiktok** | organic now, paid later ($600/mo min) | $0.35-$1.00 | $0 organic → $600+ (month 4) | organic now, paid month 4 |
| **youtube** | authority building, course promotion | n/a | $0 (organic) | month 4-6 |
| **linkedin** | B2B only ($1,500+ products) | $5-$15 (CPL $75-$150) | $3,000+ (month 5) | month 5+ (B2B only) |
| **amazon KDP** | physical workbook versions | n/a | $0 | month 6+ |
| **podcast guesting** | authority, deeper connection | n/a | $0 | month 3+ |
| **twitter/x** | SKIP — only 4% brand safe | n/a | $0 | never |

> **key finding:** google paid ads ($5+ CPC) and linkedin ($5-$15 CPC) are not viable for $9-$47 products. use SEO and organic posting instead. see `ad-platform-recommendation.md` for full analysis.

### pinterest strategy (highest-priority new channel — cheapest paid ads)

pinterest is a visual search engine, not a social network. wellness and printables are top-performing categories. a single well-optimized pin can drive traffic for years. **pinterest has the cheapest CPC of any platform ($0.10-$1.50) and 32% higher ROAS than other platforms (nielsen study).**

**paid ad benchmarks (2025-2026):**
- CPC: $0.10-$1.50 (3-10x cheaper than instagram)
- CPM: $2.00-$5.00
- 83% of weekly pinterest users have purchased from pins
- native quiz pin format supports branching (can recreate interact quiz natively)

**what to pin (organic + promoted):**
- workbook cover images → link to product page
- affirmation quote cards → link to quiz
- carousel slides (repurposed from instagram) → link to blog posts
- technique infographics → link to lead magnet
- "grounding after layoff" educational pins → link to SEO blog posts
- **quiz pins** (native branching quiz format) → email capture

**target: 10-15 pins/week.** most can be repurposed from existing instagram content.

**paid budget:** $50-$150/month (month 1-2), $100-$240/month (month 3+). promote top-performing organic pins.

**expected results:** pinterest traffic compounds over 6-12 months. by month 6, expect 5,000-15,000 monthly visitors from pinterest alone (free organic traffic). paid adds 2,000-5,000 monthly visitors on top.

### etsy strategy

etsy is the largest marketplace for digital printables. top wellness journal sellers do $10K+/month. the workbook product line is already built — it just needs etsy listings.

**listings to create:**
- each individual workbook as a separate listing ($9-$27)
- the complete collection as a listing ($47)
- the 5-day grounding practice as a free-ish listing ($0-$3, for reviews + email capture)
- seasonal/themed mini-workbooks (to capture trending searches)

**etsy SEO keywords:** "layoff anxiety workbook," "career grief journal," "identity crisis after layoff," "grounding exercises printable," "self-care workbook for job loss"

**expected results:** $500-$2,000/month in first 6 months, scaling to $5,000-$15,000/month by month 12-18.

## part 8: the quiz funnel (unchanged — still the engine)

the quiz funnel from `business-goals.md` remains the primary acquisition mechanism. it now feeds a longer value ladder:

```
instagram / pinterest / etsy / SEO / ads
         ↓
"find your grounding practice" quiz (Interact)
         ↓
email capture → Kit tag (quiz-tender / quiz-identity / quiz-grounding / quiz-rebuild)
         ↓
outcome-specific email sequence (5 emails over 17 days)
  → email 1: free 5-day practice PDF
  → email 3: workbook recommendation ($9-$47)
  → email 5: course mention + soft close
         ↓
workbook purchase ($9-$47) — first transaction, trust established
         ↓
post-purchase email sequence (NEW)
  → email 1 (day 3): "how's the workbook?" check-in
  → email 2 (day 7): course preview — "want to go deeper?"
  → email 3 (day 14): course offer ($197) with workbook-buyer discount
  → email 4 (day 21): membership invitation ($39/mo)
         ↓
course enrollment ($197) — deeper engagement
         ↓
membership conversion ($39/mo) — recurring revenue
         ↓
group coaching application ($997) — high-touch, high-value
```

### updated conversion targets

| stage | target | notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| quiz start rate (from link click) | 70% | unchanged |
| quiz completion rate | 75% | unchanged |
| email opt-in (post-quiz) | 40%+ | unchanged |
| quiz → workbook purchase (21 days) | 10-12% | unchanged |
| workbook buyer → course enrollment | 15-20% | NEW — warm audience, proven trust |
| course completer → membership | 25-30% | NEW — natural next step |
| membership → group coaching | 3-5% | NEW — self-selecting high-intent |
| cold → B2B inquiry (linkedin) | 2-5% | NEW — separate funnel |

## part 10: risk analysis

### risk 1: B2B revenue fails to materialize (impact: high)

corporate workshops and licensing represent 32% of the $1M model. if this segment doesn't develop:
- B2C-only ceiling: ~$600K-$700K/year (still excellent)
- the business becomes a high-volume content + course operation
- **mitigation:** start B2B outreach by month 4. offer 3 free workshops for case studies. target HR departments at companies announcing layoffs (public data). partner with career coaches who already have corporate relationships.
- **early warning:** if zero paid workshops by month 8, pivot B2B approach — try outplacement firms first.

### risk 2: ad costs exceed returns (impact: medium)

meta ad costs fluctuate. if CAC rises above $20 for B2C with $18 AOV, paid acquisition becomes unprofitable on first purchase.
- **mitigation:** never let paid acquisition exceed 30% of customer acquisition. invest heavily in organic (pinterest, etsy, SEO). build the email list — email marketing has the highest ROI of any channel.
- **key metric:** blended CAC should stay below $12 for B2C. if it exceeds this for 2 consecutive months, cut ad spend and reallocate to organic.
- **safety net:** with the value ladder, a $12 CAC customer who later buys the course ($197) and joins the membership ($468/year) has a $700+ LTV. the first purchase can be unprofitable if the ladder converts.

### risk 3: founder burnout / capacity ceiling (impact: high)

a solo founder running B2C content, B2B sales, product development, community management, ad optimization, and workshop delivery will hit a wall around $150K-$200K/year.
- **mitigation:** hire the VA no later than month 10. systematize everything. use the membership as leverage (one-to-many). record workshops and create a "train the trainer" program so facilitators can deliver without christie.
- **key principle:** every new revenue stream must be evaluated for time-per-dollar. a $12,000 licensing deal that takes 10 hours of setup ($1,200/hr effective) beats 667 PDF sales.

### risk 4: course or membership doesn't convert (impact: medium)

if the course launch underperforms or membership churn is too high:
- **mitigation:** pre-sell the course before building it. if 50+ people pay $147, build it. if not, adjust positioning. for membership, offer a founding-member rate ($19/mo) to seed with 50 committed members before going public.
- **fallback:** even without course/membership, the multi-platform workbook sales (etsy + pinterest + IG + SEO) can reach $150K-$250K/year — still 10-15x the original projection.

### plan B: what if $1M isn't reachable?

| scenario | year 1 | year 2 | year 3 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| **conservative** (B2C focus, slow B2B) | $40,000 | $120,000 | $300,000 |
| **moderate** (balanced B2C + B2B) | $95,000 | $395,000 | $1,000,000 |
| **aggressive** (strong B2B traction) | $120,000 | $500,000 | $1,200,000+ |
| **worst case** (high ad costs, no B2B) | $20,000 | $60,000 | $150,000 |

even the worst case ($150K by year 3) is a real business with 70%+ margins and a growing audience. the floor is high.

## part 12: what makes this defensible

1. **the need is accelerating.** 20.8M layoffs/year. 350,000+ federal workers displaced by DOGE in 2025 alone. 1.9M long-term unemployed. this is structural, not cyclical.
2. **nobody occupies the space between.** career coaches are tactical. therapists are clinical. nobody addresses the identity crisis — the "who am I now?" question that 55-70% of displaced professionals carry. that's luminous pulse.
3. **the pain persists after reemployment.** research shows life satisfaction does not fully recover after job loss — even years later. the TAM includes people who found new jobs but are still carrying it.
4. **the quiz builds a moat.** every quiz response is zero-party data. we learn what displaced workers are actually feeling, in their own words, at scale. that data makes every product, email, and ad better over time.
5. **the value ladder creates compounding LTV.** a sam who enters at $12 (workbook) and ascends to course ($197) + membership ($468/year) has a $677+ LTV. with 25% of workbook buyers ascending, the model compounds.
6. **B2B is defensible by relationship.** once an outplacement firm licenses the content, switching costs are high. the grounding methodology becomes embedded in their offering.
7. **the brand voice is inimitable.** lowercase, quiet, permission-based. it can't be replicated by a corporate wellness vendor with a PowerPoint deck. the aesthetic and emotional intelligence are the moat.
