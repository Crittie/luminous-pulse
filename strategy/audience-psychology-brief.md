## Key Frameworks

### The Specificity Ladder (scroll-stopping)
1. Generic: "It's okay to not be okay" (scroll past)
2. Targeted: "Losing your job is hard" (pause)
3. Specific: "The worst part of being laid off is pretending you're fine when someone asks what you do" (stop)
4. Visceral: "Nobody prepares you for the first time you say 'I'm between things' and hear your own voice crack" (screenshot)

**Level 4 is where Luminous Pulse should live.**

### The Content Dial
```
PAIN -------- RECOGNITION -------- PERMISSION -------- PRACTICE -------- POSSIBILITY
"This hurts"   "I see you"     "You're allowed"    "Try this"     "Imagine this"
```
- Sweet spot: RECOGNITION to PERMISSION
- Never start at POSSIBILITY (toxic positivity)
- Never stay only at PAIN (trauma farming)

### What They're Actually Buying
1. **Mirrors** — the experience of being recognized
2. **Scaffolding** — structure for an identity in freefall

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Performative vulnerability
- "Turn your layoff into a launch" energy
- Generic advice disguised as wisdom
- Content that names pain but offers nothing
- Hustle culture masquerading as self-care
