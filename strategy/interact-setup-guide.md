# interact setup guide — "find your grounding practice"

> **estimated time:** 45-60 minutes
> **what you'll have at the end:** a live quiz connected to Kit, tagging subscribers by outcome, triggering 4 personalized email sequences
> **never call it a "quiz"** — in all copy facing sam, it's a "self-assessment" or "grounding practice"

you don't need to read every workbook description and figure out which one fits.

you answer 6 questions. we tell you exactly where to start — based on where you actually are, not where you think you should be.

no judgment. no scoring. no right or wrong answers. just a quiet inventory of what you're carrying right now.

takes about 2 minutes. completely private.
```

## step 6: build the 4 outcomes

in Interact, go to **Results** and add 4 outcomes. title and copy for each:

---

### outcome 1: the tender one

**result title:**
```
you're the tender one.
```

**result body:**
```
you're in the raw part. the grief is still fresh — and nobody around you seems to understand the weight of it.

that's not weakness. that's honesty. most people spend months pretending this doesn't hurt. you're already further along than you think, because you're willing to look at it.

your starting point isn't motivation or strategy. it's naming. the grief has a shape, and until you name it, it sits in your chest unnamed and impossible to carry.
```

**recommended product section:**
```
your starting point: "tender landings"

44 pages for naming what nobody talks about. unsent letters to the role that's gone. grief timelines. permission slips. a space to feel what you're actually feeling — on paper, in private, at your own pace.

```

**button text:** `get tender landings →`
**button link:** [YOUR KIT COMMERCE LINK for tender landings]

**below button (small text):**
```
or start free — your 5-day grounding practice is on its way to your inbox right now.
```

**Kit tag to apply:** `quiz-tender`

---

### outcome 2: the unnamed one

**result title:**
```
you're the unnamed one.
```

**result body:**
```
the job is gone, but the identity crisis stayed. you keep asking yourself who you are without the role — and nobody around you knows that's the real question.

everyone keeps asking "what's next?" but the actual question, the one that wakes you up at 2am, is "who am I now?"

your starting point isn't career planning. it's excavation. figuring out who you are underneath the title that's gone — before you try to build a new one on top of the same cracks.
```

**recommended product section:**
```
your starting point: "who am I without the title?"

49 pages of identity work. 8 guided exercises: the 20 things exercise, the identity archaeology dig, the values sort, the "who knew you before the title?" inventory. not career planning. identity work.

$15 · printable · instant download
```

**button text:** `get the identity workbook →`
**button link:** [YOUR KIT COMMERCE LINK for who am I without the title?]

**below button (small text):**
```
or start free — your 5-day grounding practice is on its way to your inbox.
```

**Kit tag to apply:** `quiz-identity`

---

### outcome 3: the bracing one

**result title:**
```
you're the bracing one.
```

**result body:**
```
you need something immediate. a way to lower the temperature when the spiral starts — before the interview, the phone call, the moment you have to perform being okay.

you're not looking for deep reflection right now. you're looking for a tool that works in 2 minutes flat.

your starting point isn't journaling or naming. it's regulation. calming the nervous system first, so everything else becomes possible.
```

**recommended product section:**
```
your starting point: "before the room"

a timed grounding ritual for the moment everything feels like too much. the 60-second cold reset. the 4-7-8 protocol. the physiological sigh. the 5-4-3-2-1 ground. evidence-based techniques that actually lower your heart rate. a tear-out reference card that fits in your pocket.

```

**button text:** `get before the room →`
**button link:** [YOUR KIT COMMERCE LINK for before the room]

**also show (secondary):**
```
want the daily version? "30 days of ground" ($17) — one page, one prompt, one breath, every day for a month.
```

**second button:** `see 30 days of ground →` → [YOUR KIT COMMERCE LINK]

**Kit tag to apply:** `quiz-grounding`

---

### outcome 4: the rebuilder

**result title:**
```
you're the rebuilder.
```

**result body:**
```
you've been in this for a while. the acute grief has softened into something quieter — but the rebuilding feels endless. some days you're hopeful. some days you're hollow. most days you're both.

you don't need someone to tell you it gets better. you need structure. something that meets you where you are and walks with you through the long middle.

your starting point isn't crisis intervention. it's sustained practice. a structure that holds you through the weeks when motivation disappears and all you have left is the routine.
```

**recommended product section:**
```
your starting point: "steady"

a 12-week guided reflection practice for the long middle. weekly themes. structured reflection prompts. analog activities (things that don't involve a screen). built for the part nobody prepared you for — the part where you're not in crisis anymore, but you're not okay yet either.

$15 · printable · instant download
```

**button text:** `get steady →`
**button link:** [YOUR KIT COMMERCE LINK for steady]

**also show (secondary):**
```
want everything? "the complete grounding collection" ($47) — all 8 workbooks, 404 pages, every stage of the journey. 67% less than buying individually.
```

**second button:** `get the complete collection →` → [YOUR KIT COMMERCE LINK]

**Kit tag to apply:** `quiz-rebuild`

---

## step 7: email gate

in the **Email Capture** settings:

**headline:**
```
your results are ready.
```

**body:**
```
we'll send your full grounding profile + a free 5-day grounding practice (printable PDF — no app, no account, just you and a pen).
```

**email field label:** `your email`

**button text:** `see my results`

**privacy note (small text):**
```
we'll never share your email. you can unsubscribe anytime. we send grounding words, not spam.
```

**settings:**
- require email: ✓
- show GDPR checkbox: ✓ (for international subscribers)
- show partial result before email gate: ✓ (show the outcome title, gate the body + product recommendation)

---

## step 8: connect interact → kit

1. in Interact, go to **Integrations**
2. find **Kit (ConvertKit)** and click **Connect**
3. you'll need your **Kit API key** — find it in Kit → Settings → Advanced → API
4. paste the API key and authorize

**mapping each outcome to a Kit tag:**

| outcome | kit tag to apply |
|---------|-----------------|
| the tender one | `quiz-tender` |
| the unnamed one | `quiz-identity` |
| the bracing one | `quiz-grounding` |
| the rebuilder | `quiz-rebuild` |

> **Note:** you'll need to create these 4 tags in Kit first if they don't exist (Kit → Subscribers → Tags → Add Tag)

**also tag all quiz completers with:** `lead-magnet-downloaded` (so they get the free PDF)

---

## step 9: create the 4 Kit tags (if not done)

go to Kit → Subscribers → Tags and add:

- `quiz-tender`
- `quiz-identity`
- `quiz-grounding`
- `quiz-rebuild`

> these tags will trigger the 4 outcome-specific email sequences in `quiz-outcome-email-sequences.md`

---

## step 10: set up the 4 outcome sequences in Kit

each of the 4 quiz outcome sequences is written in `quiz-outcome-email-sequences.md`. you'll build 4 sequences in Kit → Automations → Sequences.

**for each sequence:**
- trigger: when tag `quiz-[outcome]` is added
- sequence timing: Day 0 / Day 3 / Day 7 / Day 12 / Day 17
- subject lines and body copy: copy from `quiz-outcome-email-sequences.md`

**replace these placeholders in each email with real links:**
- `[download the free 5-day grounding practice →]` → your Kit form link or PDF link
- `[get "tender landings" — $12 →]` → Kit Commerce link
- `[get "who am I without the title?" — $15 →]` → Kit Commerce link
- `[get "before the room" — $9 →]` → Kit Commerce link
- `[get "steady" — $15 →]` → Kit Commerce link
- `[get the recovery starter — $27 →]` → Kit Commerce link
- `[get the complete collection — $47 →]` → Kit Commerce link

---

## step 11: design settings

in Interact's **Design** tab:

| setting | value |
|---------|-------|
| background | cream `#FAF6F1` or white |
| text color | navy `#1a2744` |
| accent color | amber `#F4C430` |
| button background | navy `#1a2744` |
| button text | white `#FFFFFF` |
| font | Helvetica or system sans-serif |
| logo | upload `logo-abstract-sanctuary-transparent.png` |
| no stock photos | keep it clean and text-focused |

---

## step 12: get your quiz link

1. in Interact, click **Publish** or **Get Link**
2. your quiz URL will be something like: `app.tryinteract.com/quiz/[your-quiz-id]`
3. Interact also gives you an **embed code** if you want to add it to luminouspulse.co

**add UTM parameters to the link when sharing on IG:**
```
?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=bio&utm_campaign=grounding-assessment
```

---

## step 13: update your links

once the quiz is live:

1. **Beacons:** change the primary CTA from the lead magnet to the quiz link
2. **Instagram bio:** update to `find your grounding practice →` with the quiz link
3. **Website:** optionally add a quiz CTA below or alongside the Kit email form

---

## step 14: test the full flow

before going live:

- [ ] take the quiz yourself — complete all 6 questions
- [ ] enter a test email address
- [ ] confirm the correct outcome appears
- [ ] confirm the Kit tag is applied (check Kit → Subscribers)
- [ ] confirm the outcome email sequence triggers (check Kit → Automations)
- [ ] confirm the free PDF incentive email sends
- [ ] check on mobile — most of sam's traffic is phone

---

## quick reference: outcome scoring guide

> if Interact asks you to set up scoring manually, here's the full matrix:

| question / answer | tender | unnamed | bracing | rebuilder |

| Q6: short | | | +1 | +1 |
| Q6: names feelings | +2 | +1 | | |
| Q6: tells me where to start | | | | +2 |

**highest score = outcome assigned.** in case of tie: tender > unnamed > bracing > rebuilder (raw vs. rebuild order).

---

## what to do after the quiz is live

per `cross-platform-calendar.md` launch sequence:

1. **first IG story:** "I made something for 2am. take the self-assessment in my bio." → swipe up or link sticker to quiz
2. **first reel CTA:** "which one sounds like you?" → direct to quiz in bio
3. **update bio:** `find your grounding practice → [link]`
4. **monitor daily for first week:** completion rate (target 70%+), email opt-in rate (target 40%+)
