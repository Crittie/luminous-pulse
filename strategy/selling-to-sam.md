# selling to sam — sharpened ad strategy & content playbook

> this document rewrites the ad strategy, content approach, and specific copy through sam's eyes.
> sam is a 34-year-old former senior PM, laid off 6 weeks ago, scrolling instagram at 2am, not talking about it, ashamed of needing help.
> every word below is written for that person in that moment.

## what changed from the original strategy

| original | sharpened for sam |
|----------|-----------------|
| framed around "human vs AI" | framed around **identity loss after layoff** |
| CTAs: "tag someone," "comment below" | CTAs: **save, DM, link in bio** (nothing public) |
| targeting: career change + self-improvement | targeting: **mental health + mindfulness + journaling** (sam isn't on IG for career content) |
| products presented as a catalog to browse | products **prescribed based on emotional state** ("you're feeling this → start here") |
| copy says "grief journal" in ads | copy says **"44 pages for naming what nobody talks about"** (grief appears inside, not outside) |
| content posted during work hours | **key content scheduled for 9pm-12am** (the spiral hours) |
| hook style: aspirational | hook style: **permission + naming** ("you don't have to" + "the way your chest tightens when...") |

---

## part 1: sam's journey — what to show, when, and where

### stage 1: the crack (sam doesn't know we exist)

**when**: 2am scroll. sam is on the couch. partner asleep. scrolling wellness/mental health content on IG. not looking for us.

**goal**: stop the scroll. make sam feel seen. no ask. no sell. just: *someone understands.*

**content type**: organic reels + quote cards
**posting time**: 9pm-12am (schedule via Metricool)
**frequency**: 3-4x/week

#### scroll-stopping hooks for sam

these are the exact lines that go on slide 1 of a carousel or the first 2 seconds of a reel. each one names something sam is carrying but hasn't said out loud.

**permission hooks** (sam's #1 scroll-stop trigger):
1. "you don't have to apply to anything today."
2. "you don't have to know what's next. you just have to get through tonight."
3. "you're allowed to grieve a job. even if nobody sends flowers for it."
4. "you don't have to be brave about this. you can just be honest."
5. "it's okay that you can't explain what you're feeling. you don't owe anyone a narrative."

**naming hooks** (name the exact feeling sam can't articulate):
6. "the way your chest tightens when someone asks 'so what do you do now?'"
7. "the silence after you close the laptop and there's nothing to do and nowhere to be."
8. "scrolling job boards at 2am knowing it won't help but not being able to stop."
9. "telling everyone you're fine. knowing you're not. not knowing what to call the thing between."
10. "the weird guilt of being sad about a job when other people have 'real' problems."

**mid-conversation hooks**:
11. "can we talk about the part nobody mentions? the part where you don't know who you are anymore?"
12. "okay but why does nobody talk about the identity crisis that comes after the layoff?"
13. "nobody prepared me for the grief. not the job loss. the grief."

#### CTAs for stage 1 (nothing public)

- "save this for 2am." (not "comment below")
- "screenshot this. you'll need it." (private action)
- "send this to someone who needs it." (DM share, not tag)
- "follow for more." (low commitment)

#### what NOT to post in stage 1

- anything about AI replacing jobs (sam's layoff was a mass restructuring, not AI)
- "you're better than a machine" (sam doesn't need to be compared to a machine — they need to be *seen*)
- "tag a friend" / "comment your story" (sam is invisible on purpose)
- career advice, job tips, resume help (that's LinkedIn. IG is the escape.)
- anything with "hustle," "pivot," "opportunity," "reinvent"

---

### stage 2: the whisper (sam followed us 3-7 days ago, watching silently)

**when**: sam has been saving posts. watching stories. hasn't engaged publicly. follows but hasn't clicked bio yet.

**goal**: move sam from saving posts → clicking bio → downloading lead magnet.

**content type**: carousels (peek-inside content) + stories (polls — private interaction)
**frequency**: 2-3x/week carousels + daily stories

#### carousel concepts for sam

**carousel A: "5 grounding words for when you can't sleep"**

| slide | copy |
|-------|------|
| 1 (hook) | 5 grounding words for when you can't sleep |
| 2 | "I don't have to solve my life tonight. I just have to get through tonight." |
| 3 | "the panic is not a prediction. it's just a feeling. feelings pass." |
| 4 | "I am not behind. there is no schedule for grief." |
| 5 | "the fact that I'm still here, still trying — that is the evidence." |
| 6 | "I will not measure my worth by the number of applications I sent today." |
| 7 (CTA) | save this for the next night you can't sleep. or send it to someone who's awake right now too. |
| 8 (bridge) | want 5 more? free grounding practice in bio. printable. offline. 2 minutes a day. |

**carousel B: "what nobody tells you about losing a job"**

| slide | copy |
|-------|------|
| 1 (hook) | what nobody tells you about losing a job |
| 2 | nobody tells you it's grief. real grief. for a role, a team, a version of yourself that's gone. |
| 3 | nobody tells you the hardest question won't be "what's next?" it'll be "who am I now?" |
| 4 | nobody tells you the shame is worse than the loss. the feeling that you should be handling this better. |
| 5 | nobody tells you that "you'll find something better" is the loneliest sentence in the english language. |
| 6 | nobody tells you it's okay to not be okay. so I'm telling you: it's okay to not be okay. |
| 7 | nobody tells you the rebuilding doesn't start with a resume. it starts with a breath. |
| 8 (CTA) | save this. send it to someone. or just sit with it for a second. that's enough. |

**carousel C: "5 things that are true about you right now"**

| slide | copy |
|-------|------|
| 1 (hook) | 5 things that are true about you right now (even if you don't feel them) |
| 2 | you are more than your job title. you always were. |
| 3 | the people who love you didn't love your LinkedIn headline. |
| 4 | your competence didn't evaporate when your role did. |
| 5 | you are allowed to be angry and sad and hopeful at the same time. |
| 6 | you don't need to perform recovery. you need to actually feel it. |
| 7 (affirmation) | say this: "I am whole without a title. I always was." |
| 8 (CTA) | free 5-day grounding practice — link in bio. printable. private. no app. no account. just you and a pen. |

#### story strategy (private engagement)

sam won't comment, but sam *will* tap a poll in stories. stories feel private.

- **poll**: "are you awake right now? 🙋 / I should be sleeping"
- **poll**: "honest check-in: how are you actually doing? fine / not fine"
- **slider**: "how heavy is the unnamed thing you're carrying right now?" (scale emoji)
- **quiz**: "which grounding word do you need today?" (reveal = the affirmation)
- **question box**: "what's one thing you wish someone would say to you right now?" (private replies → content ideas)

these are all private interactions. sam can engage without anyone seeing.

---

### stage 3: the exhale (sam downloaded the lead magnet)

**when**: sam clicked bio, downloaded the 5-day grounding practice. did day 1 that night at the kitchen table.

**goal**: deliver so much value in the free practice that sam starts trusting us. the email sequence carries the weight here, not IG.

**what IG does in this stage**: reinforce. sam sees our posts in their feed and thinks "that's the grounding practice brand." familiarity. consistency. trust.

**content type**: value reels (grounding techniques sam can try right now)

#### reel concepts for sam (stage 3)

**reel A: "one thing for when you can't sleep" (30 sec)**

[text on screen, slow, calm audio]

you're awake. I know.

here's one thing.

put your hand on your chest.

breathe in for 4.

hold for 4.

out for 6.

repeat until the noise quiets.

you don't need to solve anything tonight.

[end card]: follow @luminouspulse.co for more.

---

**reel B: "the 5-4-3-2-1 ground" (30 sec)**

[text on screen, gentle pace]

when the spiral starts, try this:

name 5 things you can see.
4 things you can touch.
3 things you can hear.
2 things you can smell.
1 thing you can taste.

you're back in the room now.

this is yours. use it whenever you need it.

[end card]: free grounding practice — link in bio

---

**reel C: "I was in a meeting" — the origin story (45-60 sec)**

[talking head, natural light, quiet]

I want to tell you something I haven't shared publicly.

last year I was in a meeting where someone demoed a tool that could do — in 45 seconds — something that took me two days to produce.

nobody looked at me. but I felt it.

that night I went home and spiraled. not about the tool. about what I was worth without the thing I thought made me valuable.

and here's what I realized: the spiral wasn't about AI. it was about identity. I had tied my worth to my output. and when a machine matched my output, I didn't know who I was without it.

that's the crisis nobody talks about. it's not a skills gap. it's an identity gap.

that's why I started writing grounding words. not to fix it. to name it.

[end card]: free 5-day grounding practice — link in bio

---

### stage 4: the naming (sam is on the email list, reading at 2am)

**when**: 7-14 days after signup. sam has done some or all of the 5-day practice. something small has shifted. nurture emails are arriving.

**goal**: move sam from "this free thing helped" to "I think I need more." the email sequence does the heavy lifting (see `kit-nurture-sequence-update.md`). IG reinforces.

**what IG does in this stage**: show peek-inside content from the workbooks. not a sales pitch — a window into the experience.

#### retargeting ad creative for sam (warm audience)

**ad 1: the prescription ad (carousel, 5 slides)**

this is the most important ad. it tells sam which workbook to buy.

| slide | copy |
|-------|------|
| 1 (hook) | where are you right now? |
| 2 | "I just got the news and I can't breathe." → a 28-page grounding guide for the 30 minutes before the room. $9. |
| 3 | "I'm grieving and I don't know what to do with it." → 44 pages for naming what nobody talks about. $12. |
| 4 | "I don't know who I am anymore." → 49 pages of excavating who you are underneath the title. $15. |
| 5 (CTA) | you don't need all of them. you need the one that matches where you are. link in bio. |

**targeting**: email subscribers who haven't purchased (upload Kit list to Meta). 30-day IG engagers. Website visitors.

**why this works for sam**: sam doesn't want to browse. sam wants to be told "this one." the carousel diagnoses the feeling and prescribes the product. each slide is a different entry point.

---

**ad 2: the peek-inside ad (carousel, 5 slides — "tender landings")**

| slide | copy |
|-------|------|
| 1 (hook) | inside "tender landings" — a grief journal for career loss |
| 2 | [photo of actual workbook page] "name the thing you lost. not the job. the other thing." |
| 3 | [photo of unsent letters section] a space to write the letter you'll never send. |
| 4 | [photo of permission slip page] permission to grieve a job the way you'd grieve anything else. |
| 5 (CTA) | 44 pages. printable. $12. written for the version of you that's still in the thick of it. link in bio. |

**why this works for sam**: sam is skeptical ("this won't actually help"). showing the actual pages — especially the unsent letters prompt and the permission slip — creates the "I need to answer that" feeling that is sam's buy trigger.

---

**ad 3: the objection-handling ad (single image or reel)**

format: text on screen, simple.

"I should be job hunting, not journaling."

I hear that a lot.

here's the thing: the job hunt works better when you're not running from yourself.

15 minutes with a pen. then go send the applications.

this isn't instead of the search. it's what makes the search bearable.

[CTA]: free grounding practice — link in bio. (not selling the workbook directly. the email sequence converts.)

---

**ad 4: the evidence ad (reel, 20 sec)**

for sam's "this won't actually help" objection.

[text on screen]

neuroscience says:

handwriting activates emotional processing centers that typing can't reach.

structured reflection reduces cortisol by 25%.

naming emotions reduces amygdala activation by up to 50%.

this isn't vibes. it's biology.

[end card]: evidence-based grounding workbooks — link in bio

---

### stage 5: the door (sam buys)

**what sam buys**: "tender landings" ($12) or "who am I without the title?" ($15). the one that was named for them.

**what triggers the purchase**: nurture email 2 or 3 (day 10-14). IG reinforces but email converts.

**what IG does after purchase**: retargeting shows the next step.

#### post-purchase retargeting (existing customers)

**ad 5: the next step ad (single image)**

"you did the naming work. now here's the daily practice."

if you finished "tender landings" or "who am I without the title?" — the hardest part is done. you named it.

"30 days of ground" is the next step: one page. one prompt. one breath. one offline thing. every day for 30 days.

$17. printable. yours to keep.

[CTA]: link in bio

---

**ad 6: the bundle ad (carousel, for repeat buyers)**

| slide | copy |
|-------|------|
| 1 | you've already started the work. |
| 2 | the complete grounding collection: every workbook I've made. 404 pages. 8 workbooks. |
| 3 | grief. identity. daily practice. interviews. the slow rebuild. all of it. |
| 4 | $47 for everything. 67% less than buying individually. |
| 5 (CTA) | one download. one print. the whole sanctuary. link in bio. |

**targeting**: people who purchased any single workbook.

---

## part 2: revised ad targeting for sam

### cold audience (stage 1 — finding sam)

**interests** (combine 2-3 per ad set):

| category | specific interests | why |
|----------|--------------------|-----|
| mental health | anxiety awareness, mental health advocacy, therapy/counseling | sam follows mental health accounts |
| mindfulness | mindfulness, meditation, journaling, breathwork | sam's IG is wellness-oriented |
| life transition | personal development, life coaching, self-care | broad but overlaps with sam's feed |
| adjacent behaviors | journaling, printable planners, wellness products | product-interest signals |

**interests to AVOID**:

| avoid | why |
|-------|-----|
| career coaching | sam isn't on IG for career content |
| entrepreneurship / startup | different psychology — builders, not grievers |
| hustle culture accounts (gary vee, etc.) | opposite energy |
| motivational speakers | sam rejects performative positivity |
| resume writing / interview prep | tactical, not emotional — that's LinkedIn |

**demographics**:
- age: 28-45
- any gender (sam can be anyone)
- location: US, UK, Canada, Australia (english-speaking, layoff-heavy markets)

**behavioral signals to leverage**:
- active between 9pm-2am (schedule ads for evening delivery)
- high save rate (Advantage+ will optimize for this if you choose Engagement objective)
- video completion rate over 50% on wellness reels

### warm audience (stage 4 — retargeting sam)

| audience | source | ad to show |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| lead magnet downloaders | Kit email list → Custom Audience in Meta | prescription carousel (ad 1) or peek-inside (ad 2) |
| 7-day website visitors | Meta Pixel | objection-handling ad (ad 3) |
| 30-day IG engagers | Meta auto-audience | prescription carousel (ad 1) |
| post savers (last 30 days) | Meta auto-audience | lead magnet ad if not subscribed |
| past purchasers | Kit purchase list → Custom Audience | next step ad (ad 5) or bundle ad (ad 6) |

### lookalike audience (stage 5+ — scaling)

seed audience priority (best → good):
1. **email subscribers who purchased** (highest intent)
2. **all email subscribers** (high intent)
3. **post savers** (most predictive organic signal)
4. **video viewers (75%+)** (engaged but not yet subscribed)

create 1% lookalike first. expand to 2-3% only after 1% saturates (frequency > 3).

---

## part 3: revised A/B testing plan for sam

### test 1 (week 1-2): permission vs naming

which scroll-stop style resonates more with sam?

- **variant A (permission)**: "you don't have to apply to anything today."
- **variant B (naming)**: "the way your chest tightens when someone asks 'so what do you do now?'"
- format: same (carousel, 5 slides to lead magnet)
- budget: $5/day split 50/50
- metric: cost per email signup
- hypothesis: permission wins for cold, naming wins for warm

### test 2 (week 3-4): carousel vs reel

- **variant A**: carousel (grounding words, 8 slides, lead magnet CTA)
- **variant B**: reel ("one thing for when you can't sleep" — 30 sec, lead magnet CTA)
- budget: $5/day split 50/50
- metric: cost per email signup + save rate

### test 3 (week 5-6): prescription vs peek-inside (retargeting)

which converts sam from subscriber to buyer?

- **variant A (prescription)**: "where are you right now?" carousel — diagnoses feeling, prescribes product
- **variant B (peek-inside)**: "inside tender landings" carousel — shows actual workbook pages
- budget: $5/day retargeting split 50/50
- metric: purchase rate
- hypothesis: prescription wins because sam wants to be told which one

### test 4 (week 7-8): objection-handling

which objection matters more to sam?

- **variant A**: addresses "I should be job hunting" → "15 minutes with a pen. then go send the applications."
- **variant B**: addresses "this won't actually help" → neuroscience evidence reel
- budget: $5/day split 50/50
- metric: CTR + landing page conversion

### test 5 (month 3): audience

- **variant A**: mental health + mindfulness interests
- **variant B**: personal development + self-care interests
- metric: CPA for email signup
- hypothesis: mental health interests deliver higher intent subscribers

## part 4: content calendar — sam's week

every post is timed for when sam needs it most.

### monday

**sam's state**: staring at laptop, "should" be applying. guilt + paralysis.

**post (9pm)**: permission hook
> "you don't need to send 10 applications today. you need to send one honest one. or none. that's allowed too."

**format**: quote card
**CTA**: save this for monday mornings.

---

### tuesday

**sam's state**: coffee shop, pretending to work. performing okayness.

**post (10pm)**: naming hook
> "the hardest part isn't the job search. it's pretending you're fine while you do it."

**format**: reel (text on screen, 20 sec, ambient audio)
**CTA**: send this to someone who gets it.

---

### wednesday

**sam's state**: partner asks "how was your day?" deflection. shame.

**post (9pm)**: carousel — "5 things nobody tells you about losing a job" (carousel B above)

**CTA**: save this. or just sit with it.

---

### thursday

**sam's state**: scrolling linkedin. comparison spiral. feeling behind.

**post (10pm)**: contradiction hook
> "everyone on LinkedIn is 'excited to announce.' nobody posts 'I cried in the shower this morning.' but here you are. and that's braver than any announcement."

**format**: quote card
**CTA**: screenshot this. send it to yourself for tomorrow.

---

### friday

**sam's state**: interview prep or rejection email. hope or devastation.

**post (9pm)**: grounding technique reel
> "before the interview. before the email. before the phone call. try this: cold water on your wrists. 10 seconds. feel your heart rate drop. you're still here."

**format**: reel (30 sec, text + calm audio)
**CTA**: free grounding practice — link in bio.

---

### saturday

**stories only** — polls, check-ins, behind the scenes.

- "how are you actually doing this weekend? fine / not fine"
- "what would you do with a day where you had zero obligations?"
- share a quiet moment — tea, notebook, morning light (brand aesthetic)

---

### sunday

**rest or repurpose.** repost the week's best-performing content. or nothing. sam needs to see that we don't perform productivity either.

---

## part 5: revised organic content guidelines

### what to post more of

| type | example | why it works for sam |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| permission posts | "you don't have to pivot today" | sam's #1 scroll-stop trigger |
| naming posts | "the unnamed thing you carry" | names what sam can't articulate |
| grounding techniques | "breathe in 4, hold 4, out 6" | immediate value, builds trust |
| peek-inside workbook pages | photo of actual prompt | creates "I need to answer that" curiosity |
| the origin story | "I was in a meeting..." | vulnerability builds trust |
| 2am content | "you're awake. I know." | meets sam exactly where they are |

### what to post less of

| type | example | why it doesn't work for sam |
|------|---------|---------------------------|
| human vs AI framing | "you are the original intelligence" | sam's crisis isn't about AI — it's about identity after layoff |
| aspirational affirmations | "I choose to see change as an invitation" | feels tone-deaf to someone in grief |
| productivity/optimization tips | "optimize your morning routine" | sam can't get out of bed some mornings |
| "tag a friend" CTAs | any public engagement request | sam is invisible on purpose |
| bright, polished graphics | stock-photo energy | breaks the "stolen moment" aesthetic |
| long motivational monologues | "you're a warrior!" energy | sam doesn't want to be motivated. they want to be seen. |

### the 60/20/10/10 content split (revised for sam)

| type | % | what it looks like |
|------|---|-------------------|
| **naming + permission** | 60% | "you don't have to..." / "the way your chest tightens when..." — pure emotional resonance. no sell. |
| **grounding techniques** | 20% | breathwork, 5-4-3-2-1, cold water reset, body scans — immediate value sam can use tonight. |
| **peek-inside / soft sell** | 10% | workbook page photos, "inside tender landings," the prescription carousel — showing, not selling. |
| **direct promotion** | 10% | "I made this for the feeling you can't name. $12." — no more than 1x every 10 days. |

---

## part 6: the selling rules for sam (do's and don'ts of every ad and post)

### language sam responds to

| use | avoid |
|-----|-------|
| "grounding practice" | "self-help" |
| "evidence-based techniques" | "healing journey" |
| "printable workbook" | "digital download" |
| "44 pages for naming what nobody talks about" | "grief journal" (in ads — fine inside the product) |
| "neuroscience shows" | "I believe" |
| "private. offline. just you and a pen." | "join our community" |
| "you don't need to" | "you should" |
| "start here" | "browse our collection" |
| "for the version of you that's still in the thick of it" | "transform your life" |
| "$12" (plain, no justification) | "only $12!" or "just $12!" (desperate energy) |

### sam's objections addressed in copy

| objection | where to address | exact copy |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| "I should be job hunting" | ad 3, nurture email 1, post captions | "the job hunt works better when you're not running from yourself. 15 minutes. then go send the applications." |
| "this won't actually help" | ad 4, nurture email 3, workbook descriptions | "handwriting activates emotional processing centers that typing can't reach. this isn't vibes. it's neuroscience." |
| "I feel stupid buying this" | never stated directly — addressed through framing | call it a "grounding practice" and "workbook," not "journal" or "self-help." sam doesn't buy self-help. sam buys tools. |
| "money is tight" | nurture email 5, ad soft-close | "the free practice is yours forever. if you want to go deeper, the gentlest entry point is $9." remove pressure. |

### the prescription model

every product recommendation follows this format:

```
if you're feeling [specific emotion] → [product name] ($price).
[one sentence about what's inside].
[one sentence about what it does for them].
```

examples:

> if you're in the first two weeks and the grief is still raw → "tender landings" ($12). 44 pages for naming what hurts, writing the letters you'll never send, and finding what remains. for the version of you that's still in the thick of it.

> if you have an interview coming and your hands are shaking → "before the room" ($9). a timed grounding ritual for the 30 minutes before. evidence-based nervous system techniques that actually lower your heart rate. fits in your pocket.

> if you keep saying "I'm fine" but you're not → "who am I without the title?" ($15). 8 guided exercises for rebuilding identity underneath what you lost. the question nobody asks you but you can't stop asking yourself.

---

## part 7: ad budget allocation (revised for sam's journey)

### $150/month ($5/day) — month 1

| campaign | daily | monthly | purpose | creative |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|----------|
| lead magnet (cold) | $3.50 | $105 | find sams | permission hook carousel → lead magnet |
| retargeting (warm) | $1.50 | $45 | convert sams | prescription carousel → workbook |
| **total** | **$5** | **$150** | | |

schedule: ads run 6pm-2am only (sam's active hours). this reduces wasted impressions during times sam isn't scrolling.

expected: 50-100 email signups, 2-5 sales ($24-$75 revenue)

### $300/month ($10/day) — month 2-3

| campaign | daily | monthly | purpose | creative |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|----------|
| lead magnet (cold) | $5 | $150 | find more sams | winning hook from test 1 |
| retargeting subscribers | $3 | $90 | subscriber → buyer | peek-inside or prescription carousel |
| boost best organic | $2 | $60 | amplify what's working | boost post with highest save rate |
| **total** | **$10** | **$300** | | |

expected: 100-200 email signups, 8-15 sales ($96-$270 revenue)

### $600/month ($20/day) — month 4+

| campaign | daily | monthly | purpose | creative |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|----------|
| lead magnet (1% lookalike) | $8 | $240 | scale | best-performing creative |
| retargeting subscribers | $5 | $150 | subscriber → buyer | prescription + peek-inside rotation |
| upsell past buyers | $3 | $90 | buyer → bundle | next step ad + bundle carousel |
| boost best organic | $4 | $120 | amplify | highest save-rate post of the week |
| **total** | **$20** | **$600** | | |

expected: 200-400 email signups, 20-40 sales ($240-$720 revenue + upsells)

---

## part 8: what to change in existing content

### post captions (`post-captions.md`) — priority edits

| post | current issue | fix |
|------|--------------|-----|
| QC-2 | CTA: "tag someone who needs to hear this" | change to: "send this to someone who needs it." (DM, not tag) |
| QC-7 | CTA: "comment GROUNDED" | keep — ManyChat DM trigger is private enough |
| QC-9 | CTA: "tag someone who brings warmth" | change to: "save this for someone who does." |
| QC-13 | CTA: "tell us in the comments" | change to: "DM us your answer. we read every one." |
| QC-1 through QC-6 | heavily "human vs AI" framed | these still work but should be mixed 40/60 with identity-loss content. don't lead with these — lead with permission and naming hooks. |
| QC-15 | "I choose to see change as an invitation, not a threat" | too aspirational for sam in the first weeks. move to month 2+ content. |

### carousel copy (`carousel-slide-copy.md`) — priority edits

| carousel | current issue | fix |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| carousel 1: "5 things that cannot be downloaded" | human vs AI framing | keep but don't use as first carousel. lead with "what nobody tells you about losing a job" instead. |
| carousel 2: "5 grounding words for uncertain mornings" | good as-is | keep — fits sam well |
| all carousels | CTA slides say "share with someone" | change to: "save this. or send it to someone who's awake right now too." |

### reel scripts (`reel-and-live-scripts.md`) — priority edits

| reel | current issue | fix |
|------|--------------|-----|
| reel 1: "your gut feeling is not a glitch" | human vs AI framing | move to month 2+. don't lead with this. |
| reel 2: "the original intelligence" | human vs AI framing | move to month 2+. |
| reel 3: "permission to not know" | perfect for sam | use as week 1 reel |
| reel 4: "why I started luminous pulse" | perfect origin story | use as week 2 reel |
| reel 5: "what change cannot touch" | slightly aspirational but grounded | keep for week 3-4 |
| reel 6: "POV: you found your people" | good | keep |

### ad strategy (`ig-ad-strategy.md`) — key changes

| section | change |
|---------|--------|
| phase 1 targeting | remove "career change" interest. add "mental health awareness," "anxiety," "journaling" |
| ad creative concepts | replace generic carousel with sam-specific permission hook carousel |
| A/B test 2 | already has naming vs contradiction hooks — keep but add permission hook as a third variant |
| A/B test 4 | change from "career coaching + mindfulness" to "mental health + mindfulness" vs "personal development + journaling" |
| content schedule | shift key posts to 9pm-12am instead of business hours |

## the one-page summary

**who**: sam. 34. former senior PM. laid off. silent. ashamed. scrolling IG at 2am.

**where we find sam**: instagram. wellness/mental health content. not career content. between 9pm and 2am.

**what stops sam's scroll**: permission. "you don't have to apply to anything today." not advice. not motivation. permission to feel.

**what gets sam's email**: "free. printable. offline. no app. no account. just you and a pen."

**what gets sam's $12**: "if you're feeling [this] → start here." prescription, not catalog. tell sam which one.

**what gets sam's $47**: the first workbook worked. retargeting shows the bundle. sam already trusts us.

**what sam never does**: comment publicly, tag a friend, share on stories, announce they bought a grief journal.

**what sam always does**: save posts. DM screenshots to one friend. read emails at 2am. print workbooks at 11pm. cry at the kitchen table with a pen in their hand. and then feel 2% lighter.

**our entire business model is built on that 2%.**
