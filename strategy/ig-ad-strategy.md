# luminous pulse — instagram ad & growth strategy

> built from competitive research, IG ad benchmarks (2024-2026), and Luminous Pulse product data.
> all numbers below are sourced from industry benchmarks with conservative adjustments for a new account.

## the honest truth first

most solo creators don't make money from paid ads in month 1. the median Instagram ROAS is 2.19x — meaning half of all advertisers get *less* than $2.19 back for every $1 spent. at a $27 product with ~$24 net margin, your CPA needs to stay under $15 to be profitable on the first sale. the average CPA across industries is $18.68.

**this means: direct-sale ads on cold traffic will lose money at first.**

the winning strategy is: **ads drive free lead magnet signups → email sequence converts to paid → retargeting closes the rest.**

your products are real. the copy is good. the audience is massive (1 in 3 americans have layoff anxiety). the question isn't "will this work?" — it's "how fast can we build the funnel that makes it work?"

## part 1: revenue targets

### what's realistic (based on comparable creators)

| benchmark | source | revenue |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| kit commerce average creator | Kit 2024 report (5,732 creators, $10M total) | ~$1,746/year |
| gumroad first month (no ads, small audience) | Andrey Byhalenko case study | $138/first month |
| gumroad seller (ebook, no ads) | Hazel Paradise, $32.99 SEO ebook | $14,000+ over 2 years |
| gumroad seller (organic only) | Travis Nicholson 2025 | $15,000/year |
| gumroad low-content products (30 days) | case study (118 sales, 8% conversion) | $160/month |
| instagram + gumroad (no ads, no funnels) | credit repair niche case study | $1,000 in early months |
| etsy digital planner seller (year 2) | Amma Rose Designs | $93,000/year |
| etsy digital products | InsightsByJess ($50-$60 bundles) | $168,000 cumulative |
| gumroad top digital product seller | EntreResource | $450,000 cumulative |
| notion template seller | Business Automated | $239,000 cumulative |
| average solo content creator | MBO Partners 2024 | $44,000/year |
| 50th percentile creator | Kit/Creator Economy Report | <$15,000/year |

### the reality check

| metric | number | source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| creators earning under $1,000 total | 46% of full-time creators | Kit 2024 / NetInfluencer |
| creators earning under $15,000/year | 50%+ | Kit 2024 |
| creators earning $100,000+/year | 4% | Creator Economy Stats |
| gumroad page-view to purchase rate | ~8% (well-optimized) | Low Content Profits case study |
| gumroad Discover conversion rate | 20.7% | Gumroad internal data |
| products with cover images vs without | 2x conversion rate | Gumroad data |
| email traffic conversion rate | 19.3% | Focus Digital |
| instagram traffic conversion rate | 1.08% | Driftlead |

**your advantage**: you have 8 products ($9-$47), a full funnel, and a specific underserved niche. most creators have 1-2 products and no email sequence. email converts at 19.3% vs instagram's 1.08% — which is why the entire strategy funnels IG → email → sale.

### luminous pulse targets

| timeframe | email list | revenue (organic) | revenue (organic + paid) | ad spend |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------|
| **day 1** | seed existing contacts | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **week 1** | 15-30 subscribers | $0-$27 | $0-$54 | $0-$35 |
| **month 1** | 50-150 subscribers | $50-$200 | $100-$400 | $50-$150 |
| **month 3** | 300-750 subscribers | $300-$900 | $600-$1,500 | $150-$300 |
| **month 6** | 1,000-2,500 subscribers | $1,000-$3,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | $300-$600 |
| **month 12** | 5,000-10,000+ subscribers | $3,000-$10,000 | $6,000-$15,000/month (organic + paid + other channels) | $1,000-$1,500 |

> **updated context (Feb 2026):** the $1M business plan (`business-plan-1m.md`) projects year 1 revenue of $85K-$120K across all channels (IG, Etsy, Pinterest, SEO, B2B). IG ads remain the primary paid acquisition channel for the quiz funnel. the new value ladder (workbooks → $197 course → $39/mo membership → $997 coaching) dramatically increases LTV, making higher ad CPAs profitable.

### revenue math

your product ladder creates multiple revenue paths:

| scenario | how | avg order | monthly volume | monthly revenue |
|----------|-----|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| tripwire only | impulse buys from thank-you page | $9 | 10-20 | $90-$180 |
| workbook buyers | email sequence converts 5-8% | $18 avg | 5-15 | $90-$270 |
| bundle buyers | upsell in email 4-5 | $37 avg | 2-5 | $74-$185 |
| repeat buyers | tripwire → workbook → bundle | $56 LTV | 3-8 | $168-$448 |
| course upsell | $197 × 15-20% of workbook buyers | $197 | 1-3 | $197-$591 |
| membership | $39/mo × 25-30% of course completers | $39/mo | 0-2 | $0-$78 |
| **blended month 3** | | | | **$1,500-$3,000** |

**the tripwire is the unlock.** $9 buyers have a 60-70% repeat purchase rate. getting someone from $0 to $9 is the hardest conversion — after that, $12, $15, $27 feel easy.

## part 2: ad benchmarks for our niche

### instagram ad costs (digital products, wellness, 2025-2026)

| metric | our niche estimate | industry average |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| CPC (link clicks) | $0.50-$1.50 | $0.50-$2.00 |
| CPM (cost per 1,000 impressions) | $5-$12 | $7-$12 |
| CTR (click-through rate) | 0.8%-2.0% | 0.8%-1.5% |
| CPA — lead magnet signup | $2-$5 | $3-$7 |
| CPA — direct $27 sale (cold) | $20-$40 | $18.68 avg |
| CPA — direct $27 sale (warm/retarget) | $8-$15 | $10-$20 |
| ROAS — cold traffic, lead magnet funnel | 1.5-3x | 2.19x median |
| ROAS — retargeting | 3-5x | 3.61x |
| landing page conversion (cold) | 1-3% | 2.35% (e-commerce) |
| landing page conversion (warm) | 4-8% | 6.6% avg |
| lead magnet opt-in rate (from IG) | 15-30% | 15-25% |
| email sequence → purchase | 5-8% | 3-5% |

### ad placement performance

| placement | engagement rate | CPC | best for |
|-----------|----------------|-----|----------|
| **reels** | 3.2% | cheapest | awareness, reach, new audiences |
| **feed** | 1.1% | moderate | highest CTR, direct response |
| **stories** | varies | $1.83 avg | urgency, retargeting, swipe-up |
| **carousel** | 20% higher than single | moderate | product showcase, saves |

**start with automatic placements.** after 2-3 weeks, shift budget to the lowest-CPA placement.

---

## part 3: phased ad strategy

### phase 1: organic foundation (weeks 1-4) — $0-$5/day

**goal**: build content library, test messaging, grow to 200-500 followers

**organic split**: 90% organic / 10% paid ($0-$5/day max)

what to do:
- post 4-5x/week (2 reels, 2 carousels, 1 static quote)
- use the content already written: `post-captions.md`, `carousel-slide-copy.md`, `reel-and-live-scripts.md`
- set up ManyChat with GROUNDED keyword
- run $3-$5/day lead magnet ad (just to test creative and start building pixel data)
- track: saves, shares, DM keyword responses, email signups

**ad setup**:
- campaign objective: **Leads** (not Traffic — Traffic campaigns average 0.52x ROAS)
- audience: interest-based (mental health awareness + mindfulness + journaling + anxiety, age 28-45). **avoid**: career coaching, entrepreneurship, hustle culture. see `selling-to-sam.md` for full targeting.
- creative: permission hook carousel (see `selling-to-sam.md` ad 1) or grounding reel (reel 9)
- landing: Kit form for 5-Day Grounding Practice
- budget: $3-$5/day
- expected: 3-7 email signups/day at $0.50-$1.50/lead

### phase 2: testing & list building (weeks 5-8) — $5-$10/day

**goal**: 100-300 email subscribers, first sales, identify winning creative

**organic split**: 70% organic / 30% paid ($5-$10/day)

what to do:
- continue 4-5 posts/week organic
- boost any organic post that gets 2x average engagement ($5-$10 for 3-5 days)
- run A/B tests on ad creative (see testing plan below)
- launch retargeting campaign on website visitors + IG engagers
- nurture sequence should be generating first workbook sales by now

**ad setup**:
- campaign 1: lead magnet (continues from phase 1, $5/day)
- campaign 2: retargeting — $9 tripwire or $12 "tender landings" to warm audiences ($3-$5/day)
- audience for retargeting: 7-day website visitors, 30-day IG engagers, email subscribers who haven't purchased
- expected: 5-10 signups/day + 2-5 retargeting purchases/week

### phase 3: scaling what works (weeks 9-16) — $10-$20/day

**goal**: 300-750 subscribers, consistent weekly revenue, profitable retargeting

**organic split**: 50% organic / 50% paid ($10-$20/day)

what to do:
- create lookalike audience from email list (need 100+ subscribers first)
- test lookalike vs interest-based (lookalikes can deliver 32% more clicks, up to 400% higher conversion)
- scale winning creative
- introduce bundle ads in retargeting
- A/B test product positioning (grief journal vs identity workbook vs daily practice)

**ad setup**:
- campaign 1: lead magnet to 1% lookalike ($7-$10/day)
- campaign 2: retargeting workbook carousel to warm audience ($3-$5/day)
- campaign 3: bundle offer to past purchasers ($3-$5/day)
- expected: 10-20 signups/day + 5-10 purchases/week

---

## part 4: A/B testing plan

### testing priority order (test one variable at a time)

| priority | what to test | why | duration | minimum data |
|----------|-------------|-----|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **creative format** | biggest impact on performance | 7-14 days | 1,000 impressions/variant |
| 2 | **hook/headline** | determines scroll-stop rate | 7-14 days | 1,000 impressions/variant |
| 3 | **CTA copy** | affects conversion after click | 7-14 days | 50+ conversions/variant |
| 4 | **audience segment** | only test after creative is optimized | 14-21 days | 1,000 impressions/variant |
| 5 | **placement** | use auto first, test manual later | 14 days | enough data for CPA comparison |

### month 1 testing schedule

**test 1 (week 1-2): creative format**
- variant A: carousel ad — 5 slides showing lead magnet pages + CTA
- variant B: reel ad — 15-second page flip-through of lead magnet
- budget: $5/day split 50/50
- metric: cost per email signup
- expected winner: reels for reach, carousel for conversions

**test 2 (week 3-4): emotional hook**
- variant A: naming hook — "the way your chest tightens when someone asks 'so what do you do?'"
- variant B: contradiction hook — "everyone says 'this is your chance.' nobody talks about the part where you don't know who you are."
- budget: $5/day split 50/50 (use winning format from test 1)
- metric: CTR + cost per signup

### month 2 testing schedule

**test 3 (week 5-6): lead product**
- variant A: lead with "tender landings" ($12, grief journal)
- variant B: lead with "before the room" ($9, interview guide)
- budget: $5/day retargeting split 50/50
- metric: purchase rate from warm audience

**test 4 (week 7-8): audience segment**
- variant A: interest targeting (mental health awareness + mindfulness + journaling)
- variant B: interest targeting (personal development + self-care + anxiety)
- budget: $5/day split 50/50
- metric: CPA for email signup

### month 3 testing

**test 5**: lookalike audience (from email list) vs best interest-based audience
**test 6**: bundle positioning ($47 "complete collection" vs $27 "recovery starter")

### rules for all tests

- run for minimum 7 days — no exceptions
- need 1,000+ impressions per variant before judging
- only change ONE variable per test
- keep winning variant as the new control
- document results in a spreadsheet (date, test, variants, winner, CPA, CTR, notes)

## part 5: product-specific ad strategy

### which products to promote where

|---------|-------|------------|---------|------|
| 5-day grounding practice | free | paid ads + organic | lead magnet carousel/reel | always (primary ad) |

| "30 days of ground" | $17 | email sequence + organic | reel (daily ritual) | month 2+ |
| "the in-between" | $27 | email sequence + retargeting | carousel (8 chapters) | month 2+ |
| "the recovery starter" | $27 | retargeting | single image (3 workbooks fanned) | month 2+ (warm audience only) |
| "the complete collection" | $47 | retargeting to buyers | carousel (all 8 workbooks) | month 3+ (past purchasers) |

### ad creative concepts ready to test

> **Full ad creative briefs with exact copy are in `selling-to-sam.md` (ads 1-6).** Summary below.

**lead magnet ad (primary — run first)**:
- format: carousel, 5 slides
- slide 1: "you don't have to apply to anything today." (permission hook — Sam's #1 scroll-stop)
- slide 2: "5 grounding words. one for each day this week."
- slide 3: peek inside — show day 1 card from the PDF
- slide 4: "free. printable. offline. no app. no account. just you and a pen."
- slide 5: "link in bio." (simple CTA — no "comment below")
- targeting: mental health awareness + mindfulness + journaling + anxiety, age 28-45
- schedule: run 6pm-2am only (Sam's active hours)

**retargeting ad — the prescription (warm audience)**:
- format: carousel, 5 slides
- slide 1: "where are you right now?"
- slides 2-4: each names a feeling and prescribes one workbook ("I can't breathe" → $9, "I'm grieving" → $12, "I don't know who I am" → $15)
- slide 5: "you don't need all of them. you need the one that matches where you are."
- targeting: email subscribers who haven't purchased, 30-day IG engagers, website visitors

**retargeting ad — peek inside (warm audience)**:
- format: carousel showing actual workbook pages from "tender landings"
- photos of the unsent letters prompt, permission slip, grief naming exercise
- targeting: same as above

**objection-handling ads (2 variants for A/B test)**:
- variant A: "I should be job hunting, not journaling" → "15 minutes with a pen. then go send the applications."
- variant B: neuroscience evidence reel (handwriting + cortisol + amygdala stats)
- targeting: warm audience only

| retargeting ROAS | >3x | narrow audience |

---

## part 8: organic content rhythm (no ad spend required)

### weekly posting schedule (mapped to Sam's emotional week)

> **Schedule key posts for 9pm-12am** (Sam's active hours). See `selling-to-sam.md` for Sam's weekly emotional calendar.

| day | content type | sam's state | what to post | content source |
|-----|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| monday (9pm) | quote card (permission) | guilt + paralysis about applying | "you don't need to send 10 applications today." | `post-captions.md` |
| tuesday (10pm) | reel (naming) | pretending to be fine | "the hardest part isn't the job search. it's pretending you're fine." | `reel-and-live-scripts.md` |
| wednesday (9pm) | carousel | shame about needing help | "what nobody tells you about losing a job" (carousel 10) | `carousel-slide-copy.md` |
| thursday (10pm) | quote card (contradiction) | linkedin comparison spiral | "everyone is 'excited to announce.' nobody posts about crying in the shower." | `post-captions.md` |
| friday (9pm) | reel (grounding technique) | interview or rejection | grounding technique reel (reel 9 or 10) | `reel-and-live-scripts.md` |
| saturday | stories only (polls) | disconnected from family | "how are you actually doing? fine / not fine" | spontaneous |
| sunday | rest or repurpose | varies | repost best content or nothing. we don't perform productivity either. | analytics-driven |

### content promotion ratio (revised for Sam)

| type | frequency | % of total |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| permission + naming (identity loss, grief, shame) | 3-4x/week | 60% |
| grounding techniques (immediate value Sam can use tonight) | 1-2x/week | 20% |
| peek-inside / soft sell (workbook pages, prescription) | 1x/week | 10% |
| direct promotion ("I made this for the feeling you can't name. $12.") | 1x every 10 days | 10% |

### algorithm signals that matter most (2025-2026)

1. **watch time** (% of video watched + rewatches) — most important for reels
2. **DM shares** (people sending your post to friends) — strongest distribution signal
3. **saves** (people saving for later) — strongest for carousels
4. **comments** — still matters but less than shares/saves
5. **likes** — least important signal

**our content type advantage**: Sam never comments publicly. Sam never tags a friend. but Sam *will* screenshot a workbook page and DM it to one person with "you need to see this." emotional content about grief, identity, and career loss gets shared via DM (private, stigma-driven sharing behavior). DM shares = the algorithm's #1 distribution signal. **our entire growth engine runs on private sharing by people who are ashamed to engage publicly.**

---

## part 9: competitive intelligence

### what other workbook sellers are doing

| creator/brand | product | price | revenue | platform | traffic source |
|---------------|---------|-------|---------|----------|---------------|
| therapy notebooks | mental health journals | $25-$35 | undisclosed (VC-backed) | shopify | IG organic + paid |
| lavendaire | artist of life workbook | $25-$30 | $1M+ est. | own site | youtube + IG |
| amma rose designs | digital planners | $5-$30 | $93K/year | etsy | etsy SEO + IG |
| gumroad top sellers | ebooks/templates | $9-$47 | $15K-$450K | gumroad | SEO + social |
| notion template sellers | productivity templates | $15-$50 | $239K | gumroad | social + SEO |

### what makes luminous pulse different

- **niche specificity**: nobody is making grief journals specifically for career loss. therapy notebooks are general. lavendaire is aspirational. we're clinical about the wound.
- **product depth**: 8 products covering the full grief-to-ground journey, not a single workbook.
- **price ladder**: $0 → $9 → $12 → $15 → $17 → $27 → $47 — always a next step within reach.
- **evidence-based**: grounding techniques backed by neuroscience (vagal tone, bilateral stimulation, handwriting studies). not affirmation fluff.
- **voice**: lowercase, honest, no toxic positivity. this audience can detect inauthenticity with uncanny accuracy.
