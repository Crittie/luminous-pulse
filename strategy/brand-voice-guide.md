# Brand Voice Guide

## Voice in Four Words

**Warm. Grounded. Defiant. Tender.**

- **Warm**: We speak like a friend who has been where you are. Gentle tone, personal language, genuine care.
- **Grounded**: We acknowledge reality. We don't pretend everything is fine. We validate the fear before offering hope.
- **Defiant**: We have a quiet confidence. Not aggressive, but firm. "You are irreplaceable" is a declaration, not a debate.
- **Tender**: We are not afraid of softness. We use words like love, held, sacred, and heart. We are a sanctuary, not a seminar.

## Tone Spectrum

```
Aggressive  ---|------X--------  Passive
              Quietly confident

Preachy     ---|------X--------  Casual
              Sincere

Corporate   ---|----------X----  Slang-heavy
              Conversational

Fear-based  ---|------X--------  Toxic positivity
              Honest hope

Clinical    ---|--------X------  Woo
              Grounded spiritual
```

We sit in the middle — never preachy, never dismissive, never woo. We're the voice that says: *"Yeah, this is scary. And you are held. And you are going to find your way."*

## Formatting Rules

- **Use lowercase for all brand copy.** Subject lines, captions, emails, bios, CTAs, headlines — all lowercase. This is intentional. It creates intimacy, softness, and accessibility. It says: *this is a conversation, not a broadcast.*
- The only exceptions: "I" (first person pronoun) and proper nouns (Christie, Luminous Pulse, Kit, Instagram).
- Affirmations follow the same rule — lowercase unless starting with "I".

## Language Dos

| Do | Example |
|----|---------|
| Use "you" directly | "you are irreplaceable." |
| Acknowledge the fear first | "It's okay to feel uncertain. That feeling is real." |
| Use present tense | "I am held. I am here. I am enough." |
| Use sensory/embodied language | "Feel the ground beneath your feet. Breathe." |
| Keep it short (quote cards: 8-15 words) | "The part of you that loves cannot be automated." |
| Use "and" instead of "but" | "The world is changing fast *and* so is your capacity to meet it." |
| Make affirmations specific to this moment | "I will not let a headline decide how I feel about my future." |
| Vary sentence rhythm | Mix short punchy lines with one longer reflection. |
| Earn the sacred through the specific | Start in the mundane reality, arrive at the transcendent. |
| Use the body as an anchor | "Breathe," "feel your feet," "notice your hands." |
| Invite people INTO something | "Come home to what is true about you." |

---

## Language Don'ts

| Don't | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| "Just stay positive!" | Dismisses real anxiety | "It's valid to feel this. Here's what's also true..." |
| "AI will never replace humans" | Overpromises; feels naive | "There are things inside you that change cannot touch." |
| "I am in partnership with AI" | Sounds like drinking the AI kool-aid | Cut entirely. Don't center AI as a partner. |
| Jargon (LLMs, neural nets, etc.) | Alienates non-tech audience | "AI tools" or "technology" |
| "Hustle harder" / grind culture | Opposite of sanctuary energy | "Be still for a moment." |
| All caps for emphasis | Feels aggressive | Use *italics* or line breaks |
| "Don't worry" | Invalidating | "It's natural to feel this. And here's what's also true..." |
| "Not replaced. Amplified." | Tech language, pro-AI framing | "Still you. Still here. Still human." |
| "Technology amplifies my creativity" | Centers AI as protagonist | "My creativity runs on living." |
| Sarcasm about AI companies | Risks alienating part of audience | Stay pro-human without being anti-tech |
| "Manifest" / "vibration" / "frequency" | Wrong spiritual lane — New Age coded | "Presence," "stillness," "grounding," "return" |
| "Tribe" | Appropriative, cult-coded | "Community," "gathered," "together" |
| "Level up" / "optimize" / "hack" | Productivity culture | "Tend to," "return to," "remember" |

## Content Voice by Format

### Quote Cards (Static Posts)
- **Tone**: Tender, declarative, still
- **Length**: 8-15 words max
- **Structure**: One powerful statement
- **Example**: "The part of you that loves cannot be automated."

### Carousels
- **Tone**: Guiding, validating, building
- **Length**: 5-10 slides, 15-30 words per slide
- **Structure**: Name the feeling → Validate → Reframe → Practice → CTA
- **Example slide 1**: "When the future feels heavier than you can carry"
- **Example slide 5**: "You have survived every uncertain moment so far. Your track record is 100%."

### Reels
- **Tone**: Intimate, music-forward, emotional
- **Length**: 15-60 seconds
- **Structure**: Hook in first 1.5 seconds → slow build → affirmation payoff
- **Text overlay style**: Clean, centered, appearing with beat drops

### Captions
- **Tone**: Conversational, vulnerable, inviting
- **Length**: 100-300 words (keyword-rich for SEO)
- **Structure**: Hook line → short reflection → affirmation → CTA
- **Example opening**: "Last night I read another headline and felt that familiar tightening in my chest."

### Stories
- **Tone**: Casual, real, interactive
- **Length**: 1-3 slides
- **Use**: Polls ("What weighs on you more — the headlines or the silence?"), Q&As, grounding practices

### Emails
- **Tone**: Personal letter energy — like writing to one person who needs to be seen
- **Length**: 200-400 words
- **Structure**: Personal anecdote → insight → affirmation → one clear CTA
- **Sign-off style**: "You are held, Christie" or "With you in this, Christie"

### LinkedIn
- **Tone**: Raw, personal, specific. More professional register but same emotional honesty.
- **Length**: 200-600 words
- **Capitalization exception**: Standard capitalization on LinkedIn (reads better on the platform). This is the only exception to the lowercase rule.
- **Structure**: Story hook → specific moment → insight → brand mention
- **"Tech workers"**: Acceptable on LinkedIn for audience targeting. Brand copy everywhere else uses "workers."

### Blog / SEO Content
- **Tone**: Long-form version of the email voice. Warm, expert, specific.
- **Capitalization exception**: Standard capitalization for headings (SEO best practice). Body copy can use lowercase where it feels natural.
- **"Tech workers"**: Acceptable in SEO-targeted blog content for search visibility. Document this as a conscious SEO exception.
- **Statistics**: Must be sourced. Always include a citation or qualifier (e.g., "according to layoffs.fyi").

## Affirmation Writing Rules

1. **Start with "I" or "My"** — first person makes it personal
2. **Present tense only** — "I am," not "I will be"
3. **Positive framing** — "I embrace stillness" not "I am not afraid"
4. **Specific to this moment** — "I will not let a headline decide my worth" beats "I am enough"
5. **Under 15 words** for quote cards
6. **One idea per affirmation** — don't stack multiple concepts
7. **Read it aloud** — if it doesn't feel good to say, rewrite it
8. **Center the human, not the technology** — AI is the weather, not the topic
9. **Earn the spiritual through the specific** — start in the real, arrive at the true

## Voice Check

Before publishing any content, ask:

1. Would a tender, thoughtful friend say this? (If it sounds like a billboard or a LinkedIn post, rewrite.)
2. Does it acknowledge reality before offering hope? (No toxic positivity.)
3. Does it center the human, not the technology? (If AI is the protagonist, reframe.)
4. Does it feel good to read aloud? (Affirmations live in the body.)
5. Would this make someone exhale and feel less alone? (Relief = growth.)
6. Could any affirmation account post this? (If yes, make it ours — more specific, more tender, more grounded in this moment.)
