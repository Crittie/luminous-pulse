# luminous pulse — ad platform recommendation

> cross-platform paid ad analysis for the quiz funnel ("find your grounding practice").
> synthesized from 5 parallel research streams: instagram/meta ads, tiktok ads, google ads, linkedin ads, and twitter/pinterest ads. 80+ sources consulted (feb 2026).

---

## the bottom line

for a low-ticket digital product business ($9-$47 workbooks) selling to displaced workers through a quiz funnel, the math only works on platforms with the lowest CPCs and strongest organic-to-paid synergy. instagram and pinterest are the only two platforms where paid ads can be profitable at your current price points and budget.

---

## platform rankings

### tier 1: start now

| platform | role | monthly budget | expected CPL | why |
|----------|------|---------------|-------------|-----|
| **instagram/meta** | primary paid channel | $150-$300 | $1.50-$3.00 | lowest CPC ($0.40-$1.73), interact quiz native integration, 16 ads already written, advantage+ cuts CPA by 32% |
| **pinterest** | evergreen discovery + paid | $50-$150 | $0.50-$2.00 | cheapest CPC ($0.10-$1.50), native quiz ads with branching, 32% higher ROAS than other platforms, printable workbook niche |

### tier 2: add when budget allows ($600+/month)

| platform | role | monthly budget | expected CPL | why |
|----------|------|---------------|-------------|-----|
| **tiktok** | organic now, paid later | $600+ minimum | $2.00-$5.00 | $20/day minimum per ad group ($600/mo floor), external redirect friction (30-50% bounce), but 28-45 age cohort growing 86-120% |

### tier 3: specialized use only

| platform | role | monthly budget | expected CPL | why |
|----------|------|---------------|-------------|-----|
| **linkedin** | B2B only (month 4+) | $3,000+ | $75-$150 | CPC $5-$15, CPL $75-$150 — only viable for $1,500+ workshops and corporate licensing |
| **google** | SEO only, no paid | $0 | n/a | personal wellness CPC $5.00, health/wellness CPM inflated +24.73% — too expensive for $9-$47 products |

### tier 4: skip entirely

| platform | why |
|----------|-----|
| **twitter/x** | only 4% of marketers consider brand safe, negative emotional association, toxic for vulnerable audience |

## detailed analysis by platform

### 1. instagram/meta ads — PRIMARY CHANNEL

**benchmarks (wellness/health niche, 2025-2026):**

| metric | value | source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| CPC (wellness) | $0.40-$1.73 | wordstream / socialinsider 2025 |
| CPM (wellness) | $2.50-$10.81 | hootsuite / socialinsider 2025 |
| quiz funnel lead rate | 40.1% | interact platform average |
| email opt-in (quiz vs PDF) | 40% vs 18% | interact data |
| advantage+ CPA reduction | 32% | meta 2025 data |
| health/wellness ad restrictions | restricted since feb 2025 | meta policies |

**why it works for us:**

1. **quiz funnel is purpose-built for meta.** interact has native meta pixel integration. quiz completions fire as lead events. retargeting is automatic.
2. **16 ads already written.** `quiz-ad-copy.md` has 6 cold ads, 4 story ads, 4 retargeting ads, 2 upsell ads — all ready for canva design.
3. **advantage+ audience is ideal.** broad targeting with advantage+ outperforms manual interest targeting by 32% for discovery campaigns.
4. **the 2am scheduling window.** meta allows exact time-of-day scheduling (6pm-2am) — this is when sam is scrolling.

**what to watch:**

- **health/wellness restricted category** (feb 2025): cannot optimize for purchase events. optimize for lead events (quiz completions) instead.
- **frequency capping**: cold ads should stay under frequency 3, retargeting under 5.
- **creative fatigue**: refresh ad creative every 3-4 weeks.

**recommended meta ads structure:**

```
campaign 1: cold → quiz (leads objective)
├── ad set 1: broad (advantage+ audience)
│   ├── cold ad 1: permission carousel
│   └── cold ad 2: naming carousel
├── ad set 2: interests (mental health + mindfulness + journaling)
│   ├── cold ad 3: "2am" reel
│   └── cold ad 4: "which one" reel
└── ad set 3: 1% lookalike (month 2+)

campaign 2: retargeting (conversions objective)
├── ad set 1: quiz completers who didn't buy (7-30 days)
│   ├── retargeting ad 1: prescription carousel
│   └── retargeting ad 2: peek-inside carousel
└── ad set 2: email subscribers who didn't buy (upload kit list)
    ├── retargeting ad 3: objection handler reel
    └── retargeting ad 4: social proof image

campaign 3: stories (leads objective)
├── story ad 1: "the question"
├── story ad 2: "the 2am"
├── story ad 3: "the permission"
└── story ad 4: "the evidence"
```

### 2. pinterest ads — HIGHEST ROI POTENTIAL

**benchmarks (2025-2026):**

| metric | value | source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| CPC | $0.10-$1.50 | pinterest business 2025 |
| CPM | $2.00-$5.00 | improvado / shopify |
| ROAS vs other platforms | 32% higher | nielsen study |
| "printable workbook" search volume | growing 40%+ YoY | pinterest trends |
| user purchase intent | 83% of weekly users have purchased from pins | pinterest data |

**why it works for us:**

1. **cheapest clicks of any platform.** at $0.10-$1.50 CPC, pinterest is 3-10x cheaper than instagram for the same traffic.
2. **native quiz ad format.** pinterest has a "quiz pin" ad format with branching — you could literally recreate the interact quiz natively inside pinterest.
3. **printables are a top category.** "printable workbook" and "printable journal" are high-intent search terms on pinterest. these people are already looking for what we sell.
4. **pins compound.** unlike instagram stories that disappear in 24 hours, pinterest pins drive traffic for months or years. organic + paid creates a flywheel.
5. **audience is a near-perfect match.** pinterest skews female, 25-44, interest in wellness/self-improvement — overlaps heavily with sam.

**pinterest ad types to test:**

1. **standard pins** — affirmation quote cards → link to quiz landing page
2. **quiz pins** — "find your grounding practice" natively inside pinterest
3. **idea pins** — carousel-style (repurpose instagram carousel content)
4. **product pins** — workbook covers → link directly to kit commerce pages
5. **video pins** — repurpose "2am" and "which one" reels

**recommended pinterest strategy:**

- month 1: organic pinning (10-15 pins/week, repurposed from instagram content) — $0
- month 1-2: promote top-performing pins ($50-$100/month)
- month 3+: dedicated pinterest ad campaigns ($100-$150/month)
- always running: product pins for all 8 workbooks + both bundles

### 3. tiktok ads — ORGANIC NOW, PAID LATER

**benchmarks (2025-2026):**

| metric | value | source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| CTR | 0.84% (higher than FB/IG) | wordstream 2025 |
| CPC | $0.35-$1.00 | hootsuite / tiktok business |
| CPM | $4.00-$7.00 | tiktok business center |
| minimum ad group spend | $20/day ($600/month minimum) | tiktok ads policy |
| 28-45 cohort growth | 86-120% YoY | tiktok internal data |
| external link bounce rate | 30-50% | industry data |
| #layoffs views | 366M+ | tiktok search |

**why to wait on paid:**

1. **$600/month minimum is too high.** at $150-$300/month total ad budget (months 1-2), tiktok's $20/day minimum per ad group eats the entire budget for a single ad set.
2. **external redirect friction.** tiktok users resist leaving the app. 30-50% bounce on external links. the interact quiz URL will lose half the traffic before it loads.
3. **low-ticket ROAS is brutal.** at $27 AOV, $4 CPL, and 7.5% conversion = 0.5x ROAS. you lose money on every first purchase. only works if email LTV is high enough.

**why organic tiktok is still valuable:**

1. **#layoffs has 366M views.** the audience is already searching.
2. **the 28-45 cohort is the fastest-growing demographic** on tiktok — and it's sam's exact age range.
3. **spark ads (+81% ROI)** let you boost organic content that's already performing without branding it as an ad.
4. **content repurposing is trivial.** the reels scripts in `quiz-ad-copy.md` (cold ads 3, 4, 6) can be posted natively on tiktok with zero modification.

**recommended tiktok strategy:**

- month 1-3: post organic content (repurpose reels, 3-5/week) — $0
- track which videos get 10K+ views organically
- month 4+: spark ads on top performers ($10-$20/day, $300-$600/month)
- consider tiktok lead gen forms (native, no external redirect) instead of quiz URL

### 4. linkedin — B2B ONLY (month 4+)

**benchmarks (2025-2026):**

| metric | value | source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| CPC | $5.00-$15.00 | linkedin marketing solutions |
| CPM | $33.00-$65.00 | hootsuite / linkedin |
| CPL (lead gen forms) | $75-$150 | linkedin data |
| lead gen form conversion | 13% (vs 2.35% landing pages) | linkedin data |
| "open to work" users | 220M+ | linkedin data |
| minimum viable budget | $3,000/month+ | industry consensus |

**why it doesn't work for B2C workbooks:**

at $75-$150 CPL and $27 average product price, you'd need 3-6 leads per sale at a cost of $225-$900 per customer. that's a $200-$850 loss per sale.

**why it works for B2B (month 4+):**

when workshops cost $1,500 and corporate licensing is $12,000/year, the math changes completely:

| scenario | CPL | leads per deal | cost per deal | deal value | ROAS |
|----------|-----|---------------|--------------|-----------|------|
| workshop ($1,500) | $100 | 10 | $1,000 | $1,500 | 1.5x |
| package ($5,000) | $100 | 15 | $1,500 | $5,000 | 3.3x |
| licensing ($12,000) | $100 | 20 | $2,000 | $12,000 | 6x |

**recommended linkedin strategy:**

- month 1-3: organic posts only (repurpose from `linkedin-posts.md`) — $0
- month 4+: linkedin lead gen forms targeting HR directors, outplacement firms, EAP providers
- budget: $3,000/month minimum for B2B campaigns
- use `business-plan-1m.md` part 4 for B2B positioning

### 5. google ads — SEO ONLY

**benchmarks (2025-2026):**

| metric | value | source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| CPC (personal wellness) | $5.00 | google ads keyword planner |
| CPC (career coaching) | $8.00-$15.00 | google ads |
| CPM (health/wellness) | $19.69 (+24.73% inflation) | google ads |
| conversion rate (wellness) | 6.80% | google ads benchmarks |
| cost per conversion | $73.50+ | calculated |

**why paid google doesn't work:**

at $5+ CPC and 6.8% conversion rate, the cost per email capture is $73.50. for a $27 product with 8% email-to-purchase rate, that's $918.75 per sale. you'd lose $891.75 on every customer.

**what works instead: SEO (free):**

the 3 blog posts already written (`blog-post-1-identity-crisis.md`, `blog-post-2-affirmations-after-layoff.md`, `blog-post-3-ai-replacing-job-anxiety.md`) target long-tail keywords with low competition:

- "who am I without my job" — medium volume, low competition
- "grounding affirmations after layoff" — low volume, no competition
- "AI replacing my job anxiety" — growing volume, low competition

publish these on luminouspulse.co with proper schema markup. each post links to the quiz. free traffic compounds over 6-12 months.

### 6. twitter/x — SKIP ENTIRELY

| finding | data |
|---------|------|
| brand safety | only 4% of marketers consider twitter brand safe |
| emotional association | platform associated with anger, outrage, doomscrolling |
| ad revenue decline | 50%+ since 2022 acquisition |
| audience fit | sam doesn't need more anxiety — twitter amplifies it |

the luminous pulse brand voice is "lowercase, quiet, permission-based." twitter's environment is the opposite of that. every dollar spent here works against the brand.

## the math: why quiz funnels change everything

### standard lead magnet funnel
```
1,000 ad impressions → 15 clicks (1.5% CTR) → 3 emails (18% opt-in) → 0.15 sales (5% conversion)
cost: $10 CPM = $10 spent → $4.05 revenue (0.15 × $27) = -$5.95 loss
```

### quiz funnel
```
1,000 ad impressions → 15 clicks (1.5% CTR) → 6 emails (40% opt-in) → 0.72 sales (12% conversion)
cost: $10 CPM = $10 spent → $19.44 revenue (0.72 × $27) = +$9.44 profit
```

**the quiz funnel is 2.2x more leads and 4.8x more sales per 1,000 impressions.** this is why the interact quiz is the centerpiece of the entire paid strategy.
