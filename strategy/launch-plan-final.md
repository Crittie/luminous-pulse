# launch plan — luminous pulse (final)

> **this replaces all previous launch plans.** `launch-plan.md`, `launch-plan-deepened.md`, `launch-day-plan-feb17.md` — all superseded. this is the one we follow.

**created:** february 18, 2026
**launch date:** monday, march 10, 2026
**why march 10:** gives 20 days to stockpile content, set up automations, update all kit links, and seed the grid before going live. monday launch = full week of momentum.

## decisions (locked)

| decision | answer | what this means |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| face of brand? | **faceless** | no talking head, no voice, no personal video. all content = text-on-screen, graphics, animated text. producible entirely in canva. |
| what do we sell? | **workbooks** | 6 individual ($9-$27), 2 bundles ($27/$47), lead magnet (free), tripwire ($9). no course, no membership, no coaching — for now. |
| which platform first? | **instagram** | months 1-2 instagram only. pinterest adds in month 2. everything else deferred. |
| copy voice? | **raw, visceral, profanity-allowed** | see `scroll-stopping-copy.md` for complete voice rules + 50+ ready-to-design posts |
| design tool? | **canva** | christie handles all design. templates created today (feb 18). |
| scheduling tool? | **metricool** | free plan, schedule instagram + pinterest from one dashboard |
| email/commerce? | **kit** | free plan, handles email capture + pdf delivery + commerce (workbook sales) |
| dm automation? | **manychat** | free plan, keyword trigger "GROUNDED" → delivers quiz/freebie link |

## pre-launch: week 3 (mar 4–9) — schedule + seed + test

**goal:** month 1 content scheduled. grid seeded. full funnel tested end-to-end.
**time commitment:** ~6 hours across the week

### christie:
- [ ] **schedule month 1 content** in metricool:

| day | content type | frequency |
|-----|-------------|-----------|
| monday | quote card | every week |
| wednesday | carousel | every week |
| thursday | quote card | every week |
| friday | reel | every week, 12pm ET |

  - schedule weeks 1-4 (mar 10 – apr 6): 8 quote cards, 4 carousels, 4 reels = 16 posts
  - remaining 8 quote cards go in story rotation or month 2

- [ ] **seed the grid** (mar 7, 8, 9 — friday/saturday/sunday before launch):
  - mar 7: post 3 quote cards (grid row 1)
  - mar 8: post 3 quote cards (grid row 2)
  - mar 9: post 3 quote cards (grid row 3)
  - these are posts 1-9 from `scroll-stopping-copy.md` — the ones designed in week 1
  - **no hashtags, no engagement, no promotion** — just seeding so the profile isn't empty on launch day

- [ ] **test the full funnel:**
  1. click beacons link → does lead magnet download page load?
  2. submit email on kit form → do you get the incentive email with PDF?
  3. click product link in email → does kit commerce checkout work?
  4. complete a test purchase ($9 workbook) → do you get the PDF?
  5. DM "GROUNDED" to @luminouspulse.co → does manychat reply?
  6. verify metricool scheduled posts show correct times
  7. check instagram bio link works

- [ ] **engagement warmup** (mar 7-9):
  - follow 20-30 accounts in the niche (layoff support, career transition, mindfulness)
  - like/comment on 10-15 posts per day (genuine comments, not spam)
  - this warms up the account before the algorithm sees scheduled content

### end-of-week checkpoint:
- grid seeded with 9 posts ✓
- 16 posts scheduled for month 1 ✓
- full funnel tested and working ✓
- account warmed up ✓
- **ready to launch** ✓

---

## month 1: mar 10 – apr 8 — instagram only

### posting schedule:
- **4 posts/week** (mon quote, wed carousel, thu quote, fri reel)
- **daily stories** (using 6 templates in rotation)
- all content from `scroll-stopping-copy.md` + designed in canva

### daily routine (45 min/day):
| time | activity | minutes |
|------|----------|---------|
| morning | post story (template) | 5 |
| morning | check DMs + respond | 5 |
| midday | engage on 10-15 posts in niche | 20 |
| evening | check insights + reply to comments | 15 |

### content cadence:
- week 1 (mar 10-14): carousel #1 + 2 quote cards + reel #1
- week 2 (mar 17-21): carousel #2 + 2 quote cards + reel #2
- week 3 (mar 24-28): carousel #3 + 2 quote cards + reel #3

- whether profanity helps or hurts reach
- which workbook gets the most clicks

---

## month 2: apr 9 – may 8 — add pinterest + etsy + quiz

### new additions:
- [ ] **pinterest business account** — set up, verify website, create 8 boards (from `pinterest-content.md`)
- [ ] **pinterest content** — repurpose instagram quote cards as pins (1000x1500, pin descriptions from `pinterest-content.md`)
- [ ] **pin 3-5x/day** using metricool (repurposed instagram content + fresh pins)
- [ ] **etsy shop** — list 3 best-selling workbooks (or top 3 by instagram engagement)
- [ ] **quiz funnel** — build in interact:
  - 6 questions from `quiz-landing-page-copy.md`
  - 4 outcomes (tender/unnamed/bracing/rebuilder)
  - connect to kit (tag by outcome → start outcome-specific email sequence)
  - update beacons link-in-bio with quiz link
- [ ] **manychat update** — "GROUNDED" keyword now sends quiz link instead of direct freebie

### month 2 posting (instagram):
- same cadence: 4 posts/week + daily stories
- start using **carousels that end with "DM GROUNDED"** call-to-action
- mix in quiz promotion: "not sure which workbook? take the 2-minute quiz ↓"

### month 2 goals:
| metric | target | stretch |
|--------|--------|---------|

---

## month 3: may 9 – jun 8 — paid ads ($5-$10/day)

### what to run:
- [ ] **meta ads manager** — start with $5/day
  - campaign 1: cold traffic → quiz (carousel ad from `quiz-ad-copy.md`)
  - campaign 2: retargeting → workbook (people who visited but didn't buy)
  - targeting: interests in mindfulness + mental health + career change (NOT career coaching — see `selling-to-sam.md`)
  - placements: instagram feed + stories + reels only (no facebook, no audience network)
- [ ] **pinterest ads** — $3-$5/day
  - promoted pins → lead magnet or quiz
  - targeting: keywords "layoff journal," "career change workbook," "anxiety workbook"

### budget:
| platform | daily | monthly | what it promotes |
|----------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| meta (instagram) | $5-$7 | $150-$210 | quiz funnel + retargeting |

## kit commerce setup checklist

this is the critical path — products must be live before launch so email links work.

### products to upload (week 2):

| # | product name | price | pdf file | description source |
|---|-------------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | before the room | $9 | `Before-The-Room-Workbook.pdf` | `kit-workbook-before-the-room.md` |
| 2 | tender landings | $12 | `Tender-Landings-Workbook.pdf` | `kit-workbook-tender-landings.md` |
| 3 | who am I without the title? | $15 | `Who-Am-I-Without-The-Title-Workbook.pdf` | `kit-workbook-identity.md` |
| 4 | steady | $15 | `Steady-Workbook.pdf` | `kit-workbook-steady.md` |
| 5 | 30 days of ground | $17 | `30-Days-Of-Ground-Workbook.pdf` | `kit-workbook-30-days.md` |
| 6 | the in-between | $27 | `The-In-Between-Workbook.pdf` | `kit-workbook-the-in-between.md` |
| 7 | the recovery starter (bundle) | $27 | `The-Recovery-Starter.pdf` | `kit-bundle-recovery-starter.md` |
| 8 | the complete grounding collection (bundle) | $47 | `The-Complete-Grounding-Collection.pdf` | `kit-bundle-complete-collection.md` |

### emails to update with product URLs (week 2):

once products are live in kit commerce, each gets a unique URL. find-and-replace [LINK] placeholders:

| file | # of emails | links to update |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `welcome-email-sequence.md` | 2 | tripwire link, workbook recommendation link |
| `email-nurture-sequence.md` | 5 | workbook links, bundle links, collection link |
| `quiz-outcome-email-sequences.md` | 20 | outcome-specific workbook links (4 sequences x 5 emails) |
| `marketing/lead-magnet/incentive-email-copy.md` | 1 | verify lead magnet download auto-sends |

### automation rules to verify:

| trigger | action | tag |
|---------|--------|-----|
| kit form submit | send incentive email → start welcome sequence | `lead-magnet` |
| quiz complete: tender | start tender email sequence | `quiz-tender` |
| quiz complete: unnamed | start unnamed email sequence | `quiz-unnamed` |
| quiz complete: bracing | start bracing email sequence | `quiz-bracing` |
| quiz complete: rebuilder | start rebuilder email sequence | `quiz-rebuilder` |
| purchase: any product | send receipt → tag product name | `customer-[product]` |

---

## what we're NOT doing (and when to reconsider)

| thing | why not now | reconsider when |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| tiktok | need to focus. instagram first. | day 60 (month 2 end) — if instagram reels work, repurpose to tiktok |
| x/twitter | low conversion for this audience. sam doesn't buy from tweets. | day 90 — only if we need top-of-funnel reach |
| linkedin | B2B play, not where we start. expensive ads ($75+ CPL). | after 500 email subscribers OR when we have a B2B offer |
| course | no audience yet. courses need community to launch into. | after 500 email subscribers + proven workbook sales |
| membership | needs recurring content commitment + minimum members to feel alive | after course launches successfully |
| coaching | needs personal brand presence (contradicts faceless) | only if christie decides to put face to brand |
| B2B corporate | minimum $1,500 deals need credibility + case studies | year 2, after consumer success proves the model |
| amazon KDP | worth exploring but not urgent | month 4, as passive income experiment |
| youtube | long-form video is a separate content engine | month 6+, only if short-form video proves itself |
| new strategy documents | we have 20+ docs. we need zero more. | after $500 in revenue — then we earn the right to strategize again |

---

## revenue reality check

these are honest numbers. no "$1M in year 1" fantasy.

| timeframe | followers | subscribers | sales | revenue |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------|---------|
| day 30 (month 1 end) | 100-250 | 25-50 | 0-5 | $0-$100 |
| day 60 (month 2 end) | 300-600 | 75-150 | 5-20 | $50-$400 |
| day 90 (month 3 end) | 600-1,200 | 200-400 | 20-50 | $300-$1,200 |
| day 180 (month 6) | 1,500-3,000 | 500-1,000 | 75-150 | $1,500-$4,000 |
| day 365 (year 1) | 3,000-8,000 | 1,000-3,000 | 200-500 | $5,000-$15,000 |

these assume:
- consistent posting (4x/week + daily stories)
- 45 min/day engagement
- month 3 paid ads at $8-$12/day
- 2-5% email → purchase conversion rate
- average order value $15-$20

if these numbers feel low: they're realistic for a brand-new faceless account selling digital products. the upside is that the margins are nearly 100% and the content compounds. month 12 looks very different from month 1.

---

## the only rule

**if it's not on this plan, it doesn't exist.**

no new strategy docs. no new research. no new platform exploration. no "what about" rabbit holes.

the plan is: design → automate → schedule → post → engage → sell → repeat.

everything else is a distraction we can't afford.

---

## key dates

| date | what happens |
|------|-------------|
| feb 18 | canva templates + design begins |

| **mar 10** | **LAUNCH: first scheduled post goes live** |

| apr 9 | add pinterest + etsy + quiz funnel |
| may 9 | turn on paid ads ($8-$12/day) |
