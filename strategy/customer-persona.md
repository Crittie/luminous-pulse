# customer persona — "the silent one"

## meet sam

**Sam, 34. former senior project manager at a mid-size tech company.**

laid off 6 weeks ago in a company-wide restructuring. 800 people. one email. a Slack message from HR. laptop returned via FedEx.

sam has a partner and a 3-year-old. was the stable income. the one with the plan. the one who held it together. now the severance clock is ticking and the job market feels like screaming into a void.

## psychographics

### what sam believes
- hard work is supposed to lead to stability
- they were doing everything right
- asking for help means they've failed

- they should be further along in their recovery than they are

### what sam fears
- that this feeling won't pass
- that they peaked at the old job and it's downhill from here
- that the market has moved past them
- that people can tell they're not okay
- that needing a grief journal for a *job* is pathetic

---

## the emotional landscape

### what sam is feeling (but can't name)

sam doesn't have vocabulary for this. they don't say "I'm grieving." they say nothing. or they say "I'm fine."

underneath "I'm fine":
- **identity fracture** — "I don't know who I am without that title"
- **anticipatory dread** — "what if I never find something like that again?"
- **shame spiral** — "other people bounce back. why can't I?"
- **anger without a target** — "I did everything right and it didn't matter"
- **invisible grief** — "nobody sends flowers when you lose a job"

### the 2am spiral

this is when sam finds us. it's 2am. partner is asleep. sam is on the couch scrolling instagram — not career content, not LinkedIn. IG is the escape. wellness accounts. mental health memes. soft, quiet things that don't demand anything.

sam is not looking for a workbook. sam is not looking for anything. sam is just trying to get through the night.

and then they see a post that says:

> "you don't have to pivot today. you don't have to network. you can just sit here."

and for the first time in weeks, something cracks open. not a sale. not a click. just: *someone sees me.*

---

## the customer journey

### stage 1: the crack (awareness)

**where**: instagram. 2am scroll. or a friend DMs them a post.

**what stops them**: permission. not advice. not a framework. permission to not be okay. permission to not have a plan. permission to feel this without calling it a breakdown.

**what they do**: save the post. maybe follow. definitely don't comment (that's public). they watch from the shadows for 3-7 days.

**content that works here**:
- "you don't have to optimize your morning. you need to feel it."
- "the way your chest tightens when someone asks 'so what do you do?'"
- "nobody talks about the part where you don't know who you are."

**content that fails here**:
- anything that looks like career advice
- anything with "hustle," "pivot," "opportunity"
- anything polished or corporate
- anything that requires them to identify publicly as struggling

### stage 2: the whisper (consideration)

**trigger**: after 3-7 days of silently following, sam sees a post or story that names the exact thing they're carrying. not close. *exact.*

**what they think**: "how does this person know?"

**what they do**: tap bio. visit link-in-bio. maybe click the free lead magnet. still no comment. still no DM. still invisible.

**the key barrier**: sam feels shame about needing help. the lead magnet cannot feel like "self-help." it needs to feel like:
- a tool ("5-day grounding practice" sounds like a technique, not therapy)
- a private thing (printable = offline = nobody knows)
- something a competent person would use ("evidence-based" = not woo-woo)

**what gets the email signup**:
- "free. printable. no hustle culture."
- the word "grounding" (clinical, not spiritual)
- the promise that it takes 2 minutes (low commitment)
- the fact that it's a PDF they can do alone, on paper, with no app tracking them

### stage 3: the exhale (first value)

**trigger**: sam downloads the 5-day grounding practice. does day 1 that night.

**what happens**: the first affirmation names the feeling. the breathwork calms the nervous system. the reflection prompt is something they've never been asked before. they write one sentence with a pen and realize they haven't handwritten anything in months.

**what they feel**: not "healed." not "fixed." just... seen. one small exhale.

**what the email sequence does here**:
- email 1 (day 2): pure value. another technique. no sell. just "here's something for a hard morning."
- email 2 (day 5): gentle check-in. "how's the practice going?" + first mention of workbooks as something that exists. not a pitch. a whisper.

**critical**: sam is reading these emails at 2am. the tone must match the hour. lowercase. quiet. no exclamation marks. no "excited to share." just: "hey. I made something for this feeling."

### stage 4: the naming (decision)

**trigger**: nurture email 2 (day 10) — "which one of these sounds like you right now?"

this email lists 5 feelings and maps each to a workbook. sam reads all five and one hits like a punch:

> "I don't know who I am anymore."
> → you need identity work. not a career plan — an excavation of who you are underneath the title that's gone.

**what sam thinks**: "that's... exactly it."

**what sam needs to hear next**: "start here. this one. $12." not "browse our collection." not "find what resonates." sam is exhausted from making decisions. **tell them which one.** make the choice for them based on where they are emotionally.

**the objections that surface here**:

| objection | how we address it |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "I should be job hunting, not journaling" | "the job hunt works better when you're not running from yourself. this is 15 minutes. then go send the applications." |
| "this won't actually help" | "handwriting activates emotional processing centers that typing can't reach. this isn't vibes — it's neuroscience." evidence > promises. |
| "I feel stupid buying a grief journal for a job" | we never call it a grief journal in the ad. it's "44 pages for naming what nobody talks about." the word "grief" appears inside, after they've already decided this is for them. |
| "$12 feels risky right now" | "if the budget is tight, the free practice is yours forever." remove the pressure. the people who need to buy will buy when the shame drops. |

### stage 5: the door (purchase)

**what sam buys first**: "tender landings" ($12) or "who am I without the title?" ($15). not the cheapest. not the flagship. the one that was named for them in the email.

**purchase experience**: Kit Commerce checkout. simple. private. instant PDF delivery. sam downloads it, prints it at home at 11pm, and sits at the kitchen table with a pen.

**what makes them buy again** (60-70% do):
- the first workbook worked. not "cured them." worked. they felt something shift.
- the nurture email or retargeting ad shows the next step: "you did the identity work. now here's the daily practice."
- the bundle offer ($47 for everything) feels like a deal once they've already experienced one workbook.

### stage 6: the quiet return (loyalty)

**what sam becomes**: not a brand ambassador. not a testimonial. sam becomes someone who DMs a friend a screenshot of one page from the workbook with the message: "you need to see this."

**that DM is worth more than any ad.** it's private. it's trusted. it's how this audience shares — not publicly, not in comments, but in the dark. one person to one person.

**what keeps sam connected**:
- weekly newsletter with grounding words (free, forever)
- the occasional post that names something new they're carrying
- the slow, patient presence of a brand that never rushes them

---

## how to sell to sam (rules)

### do
- **name the feeling before offering the solution.** sam doesn't know what they need. they know what they feel. name it first.
- **tell them which product to start with.** "if you're in the first 2 weeks, start here." decide for them.
- **frame it as a tool, not self-help.** "evidence-based grounding techniques" not "healing journey."
- **keep it private.** printable. offline. no app. no community they have to join. no profile they have to create.
- **use lowercase.** always. the brand voice matches the hour sam finds us: 2am, quiet, no performance.
- **lead with permission, not promises.** "you're allowed to not be okay" converts better than "this will fix you."

### don't
- never use "excited," "amazing," "incredible," "transform your life"
- never put "self-help" or "healing journey" in ad copy — sam will scroll past
- never require public interaction to access value (no "comment below," no "tag a friend")
- never rush. sam's timeline is sam's timeline.
- never compare to therapy or position as a replacement — "something for between sessions" or "when therapy isn't accessible right now"
- never use stock photo energy. every image should feel stolen — like you caught a private moment.
- never use the word "pivot"

## sam's week (the context your content enters)

| time | what sam is doing | emotional state | content opportunity |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| monday morning | staring at laptop, "should" be applying | guilt + paralysis | "you don't need to send 10 applications today. you need to send one honest one." |
| tuesday afternoon | coffee shop, pretending to work | performing okayness | "the hardest part isn't the job search. it's pretending you're fine while you do it." |
| wednesday evening | partner asks "how was your day?" | deflection, shame | "when someone asks how you are and you say 'fine' but your body says something else." |
| thursday night | scrolling linkedin | comparison spiral | "stop counting other people's offers. start counting your own breaths." |
| friday | interview prep or rejection email | either hope or devastation | "before the room" content — grounding techniques for the 30 minutes before |
| weekend | family time, feels disconnected | present but hollow | "you showed up today. for your kid, for your partner, for yourself. that counts." |
| 2am any night | can't sleep, scrolling IG | the spiral | "you're awake. I know. here's one thing for right now." |

## targeting sam on instagram

### interest targeting (cold)
- career change + mindfulness (not career coaching — that's LinkedIn energy)
- mental health awareness + journaling
- self-improvement + anxiety (the intersection, not either alone)
- age 28-45, any gender

### behavioral signals
- follows wellness/mental health accounts on IG (not career accounts)
- saves posts more than likes them (private engagement pattern)
- watches reels to completion but doesn't comment (shadow audience)
- active between 10pm-2am (the spiral hours)

### lookalike seed (once we have data)
- email list subscribers (highest intent)
- lead magnet downloaders
- post savers (most predictive of purchase intent)

### what NOT to target
- "career coaching" interest — these are people looking for tactical help, not emotional grounding
- "entrepreneur" or "startup" interest — different psychology entirely
- people who follow hustle culture accounts — they'll reject the message

## the one-line version

**sam is a competent, analytical, mid-career professional who was laid off and is silently drowning in an identity crisis they're too ashamed to name. they don't need career advice. they need someone to say: "this feeling has a name, and you're not broken for having it." they'll find us at 2am on instagram, not looking for us at all — and the thing that stops their scroll isn't a product. it's permission.**
