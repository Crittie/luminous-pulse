## Page 2: How to Use This Deck

### The Practice (2 minutes)

1. **Pick one card** each morning
2. **Stand up** — posture matters
3. **Take one deep breath**
4. **Say the affirmation aloud**, three times, slowly
5. **Sit with the feeling** for 30 seconds
6. **Reflect** using the prompt on the back

The feeling follows the words.
Not the other way around.

*Tip: Pin your favorite to your desk, mirror, or laptop lid. Let it find you throughout the day.*

## Card 1

### Front
"My intuition is trained
on a lifetime of being human.
No dataset compares."

### Back (Reflection Prompt)
**Reflect**: Think of a time your gut feeling turned out to be right — when the data said one thing but you knew better. What did that feel like? That instinct isn't going anywhere.

---

## Card 2

### Front
"Technology amplifies my creativity.
It does not replace it."

### Back (Reflection Prompt)
**Reflect**: Name one creative idea you've had recently that no tool prompted you to have. Where did it come from? That source is yours alone.

---

## Card 3

### Front
"I adapt, I learn,
and I bring something to every room
that no tool ever will."

### Back (Reflection Prompt)
**Reflect**: List three skills you've learned in the past five years that you never planned to learn. Notice the pattern: you adapt. You always have.

---

## Card 4

### Front
"I am not in competition
with technology.
I am in partnership with it."

### Back (Reflection Prompt)
**Reflect**: Where in your work could AI handle the repetitive parts so you can spend more time on the parts only you can do? That reframe changes everything.

---

## Card 5

### Front
"I give myself permission
to navigate this moment
with curiosity, not panic."

### Back (Reflection Prompt)
**Reflect**: What's one thing about AI that genuinely excites you — separate from what scares you? Hold both feelings at once. That's maturity, not contradiction.

---

## Card 6

### Front
"My value is not measured
in output speed.
It is measured in judgment."

### Back (Reflection Prompt)
**Reflect**: Think of your best contribution at work this year. Was it fast? Or was it thoughtful? The things that matter most rarely come from moving faster.

---

## Card 7

### Front
"I carry things
no technology will ever replicate:
lived experience, empathy, and purpose."

### Back (Reflection Prompt)
**Reflect**: Write down one moment where your empathy changed an outcome — a conversation, a decision, a relationship. That's your evidence. Keep it close.
