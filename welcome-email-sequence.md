Hey,

Your affirmation card deck is attached — and I'm genuinely glad you're here.

Quick confession: I made this because I needed it.

I work in AI. I spend every day surrounded by tools that can write, design, analyze, and create. And some days, I'd catch myself thinking: *If this tool can do what I do... what am I even for?*

That thought is more common than anyone admits.

So I started writing affirmations — not the generic kind, but ones that spoke directly to *this* moment. The AI moment. The one where the world is shifting under our feet and everyone's pretending they're fine.

**Here's how to use the cards:**
1. Print the PDF (cardstock is nice, but regular paper works)
2. Cut along the lines
3. Pick one card and put it where you'll see it tomorrow morning
4. Read it aloud. Once. That's it.

If you only try one, start with: *"My intuition is trained on a lifetime of being human. No dataset compares."*

That's the one that changed my mornings.

Talk soon,
Christie

P.S. — Tomorrow I'll share the one affirmation practice that actually rewires how you think. It takes 2 minutes. You'll want to try it.

## Email 2: The Practice (Day 2)

**Subject line options** (A/B test):
- A: The 2-minute practice that actually works
- B: Why reading affirmations doesn't work (and what does)

**Preview text**: Most people read affirmations wrong. Here's the fix.

Hey,

Here's something no one tells you about affirmations:

Reading them doesn't do much.

I know — that feels like a weird thing to say from someone who just gave you a card deck. But hear me out.

When you *read* an affirmation, your brain treats it like information. It files it away and moves on.

When you *speak* an affirmation out loud, something different happens. Your brain hears your own voice making a declaration. It starts to take it more seriously. It's the difference between reading "I am capable" and hearing yourself say it in your kitchen at 7am.

**The 2-minute practice:**

1. Pick one affirmation card from the deck
2. Stand up (seriously — posture matters)
3. Take one deep breath
4. Say the affirmation out loud, three times, slowly
5. Sit with the feeling for 30 seconds

That's it. Two minutes.

Try it tomorrow morning with this one:

> *"I adapt, I learn, and I bring something to every room that no tool ever will."*

Say it like you mean it — even if you don't yet. Especially if you don't yet.

The feeling follows the words. Not the other way around.

More soon,
Christie

P.S. — In my next email, I'll tell you about the extended collection — 50 affirmations across four themes, each one written for exactly this moment we're in. It's the thing I'm most proud of building.

## Email 3: The Story + Soft Pitch (Day 5)

**Subject line options** (A/B test):
- A: Why I built 50 affirmations for the AI age
- B: I almost didn't launch this

**Preview text**: The honest story behind this project — and what's next.

---

Hey,

I want to tell you a quick story.

Last year, I was in a meeting where someone casually said, "We'll just have AI do that part." They were talking about the part of the project I was most proud of.

I didn't say anything in the moment. But that night, I sat with this heavy, unnamed feeling — like my skills had an expiration date no one told me about.

That feeling is what started all of this.

I started writing down the things I wanted to hear. Not vague motivational quotes. Specific reminders that my humanity — my judgment, creativity, empathy, lived experience — wasn't going anywhere. That AI was a tool, and I was the one holding it.

Those notes turned into the 7 affirmations you downloaded.

And then they turned into something bigger.

**I wrote 50 affirmations across four themes:**

- **AI-Age Empowerment** — for the moments when you wonder where you fit
- **Career Confidence** — for the days when imposter syndrome meets automation anxiety
- **Morning Motivation** — for starting your day grounded, not scrolling headlines
- **Anxiety Relief** — for the nights when the "what ifs" are loud

Each one is specific. Each one is written for *this* exact era. And each one comes with a reflection prompt to help you go deeper.

I put them all in one collection: **[Product Name: 50 Affirmations for the AI Age]**

→ **[Link to Gumroad product page]**

It's $27 — less than a therapy session, more useful than most self-help books collecting dust on your shelf.

But honestly? If the 7 free cards are enough for you, I'm happy. This project started because I needed these words. If even one of them landed for you, that's the whole point.

Either way, I'll keep showing up in your inbox with more affirmations, more real talk about navigating this moment, and the occasional reminder that your humanity is your superpower.

Thanks for being here.

With you in this,
Christie

P.S. — If the free cards helped, I'd love to hear which one stuck. Just reply to this email. I read every response.
